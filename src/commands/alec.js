  "Surprisingly thin for ABV (10.3%). Dark chocolate comes forward, hazelnut and vanilla isn't overbearing. Well done.",
  "Smoky a bit. Pleasant. Mouthfeel ok, it's a porter, not that sour or sour, which is nice, I'd prefer it less sour.",
  "Quite unique from Fruity to elaborate.",
  "Not bad, maybe not to be smashed but still not bad. Vanilla is very delicate, which is a good thing. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Last batch? Similar to what I had a few months ago. Nice NEIPA, a bit du Nord-Est style. Still cool for a non-NEIPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Really good mouthfeel, funk, apple. This is a DIPA, not a DIPA jammy and dank. Pretty good, happy to find this at the LCBO! Merci quand m√™me Renaud B. Vincent L.",
  "Beginners NEIPA, good stuff. Nice hop burn, followed by more 3F hops.",
  "I really get the pils... Coffee, chocolate, bourbon, to name a few. And that's all it is. 4.12",
  "Coffee and vanilla. Good balance. Pretty sweet, just the perfect sourness and sugar touch. 4.35",
  "Very sour, very small can is very nice. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Saturated for a time, but nice tingling on the tongue. Dryish aftertaste. Strong but decent.",
  "I think the French version is a little better. Nice texture. I like it.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Slightly lemony, somewhat tart, a little herbaceous. Very nice. 4.2",
  "Not great, but not as bad as I remember on tap. Lil can can. 4.15.",
  "Good texture, oaky, but still grape aftertaste. This is more sour than your usual kriek! 4.12/5",
  "Oooohhh... chocolate!  Really delicious! üçí, prune, lactose, slight something else is very wrong with these beers!",
  "2nd try! A little thin, but very good.",
  "Tropical, melon, good texture, nice DDH kick. Love those BBC releases! 4.12.",
  "How can you go wrong with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy? The usual BBC class, melon, tropical fruit and an amazing mouthfeel. A great DIPA üí©",
  "Nice coffee nose. Coffee, chocolate, cognac. Easy drinking, man!!! What a mouthfeel! Really nice coffee! What a mouthfeel! So good I can taste the National Hoppy üíï. And of course, the Citra. Intense.",
  "Ah, Yummy, you've finally come out of the closet to assume your real identity: you're an IPA! l knew it all along, Baby, you're the queen!",
  "Serious, fruity, slightly tart. Good saison.",
  "Very mild, delicate peach and melon, fairly dry. Low to medium. Good mouthfeel.",
  "Quite gueuzey, apple, citrus. Strong but that's not the purpose here. Would make for a pretty good summer beer. 3.85",
  "Don't look! Bitter and pungent!?!?",
  "You wouldn't know it's a collab w BBC. Typical Dominion tough-love lady...",
  "Raspberry good but not the most intense taste, much smoother. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Woody, very tropical, but a little too malty for my liking. But what I'm getting is a gose...",
  "A little short in the mouthfeel department, but hey! It‚Äôs an icon! And at $6.50, it‚Äôs a no-brainer. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Wow! I agree with an Untappd friend: like a cross btw a juicy NEIPA and a saison. A little sweet. Looking forward to their DIPA.",
  "A great old school DIPA, pleasant guava and lemon flavour, fruity finish. Fresh can.",
  "Not as fizzy as I remember. Then again, almost 3 months old. Still nice.",
  "So sweet after a year in which it was never really been. Nice Nelson Sauvin nose, but the fruit is thin.",
  "Very sour, very piney, very uninteresting.  Could have a reference, but not here. Hyped, but surprisingly well done. Thanks Tyson S.",
  "How can you go wrong with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy? The usual BBC class, melon, tropical fruit and an amazing mouthfeel. Another outstanding weekend!",
  "Nose is all coffee. In the mouth, coffee right away, then trace of vanilla and cinnamon. Nice üòã texture. Good texture. Good value for $. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Fruit, molasses, decent mouthfeel, not too shabby from LTM. Very decent regular IPA.",
  "Very creamy. Slight papaya touch. Tasty. A great NEIPA on a thin April day. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "That vinous touch, surprisingly, works with the coffee. This one seems a little more subdued than previously sampled 3f OG. üíïüíïüíï",
  "A little old school, but other than that, it tastes like rum.. Interesting to think that some people find it too sickening (doughnutty) 3.62",
  "Should have taken this before Halloween...",
  "Almost a month old but hey! It‚Äôs been growing on me, making it one of the few NEIPAs still very good. Thanks Tyson S. Matthieu L.",
  "Very nice Bourbon nose. More bourbon than wine. Nice mouthfeel. Slightly malty. Pretty good.",
  "Les thick than expected. Quite tasty. Different... Bretty, woody and somewhat oaky. Diss likes!",
  "Easy 4. Whisky again,  3.9. BBC, you're The best brew I've had in a Pepsi challenge ok... maybe not for BBC...",
  "Great mouthfeel, dank, citrusy. Strong but that dankness comes through in the mouth. I want more! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Easily the best creation from Collective Arts. Delicious fruit, great texture, but as glorious as expected from P√©ch√©. 4.35",
  "It‚Äôs boozy, but it does have a nice texture. Bor√©ale and chocolate, well, that‚Äôs what counts. 3.6",
  "Not that uninteresting that I wouldn't mind not refusing to pass up another one. Very nice stout.",
  "Mmmhhh... yummy!",
  "Still one of the very best pale ales around. Great mouthfeel, dank, right out of the can! 4.35",
  "Gusher. Quite acidic, bitter and dusty, although caramel may have been more desired. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Why do they call this an NEIPA? It isn't. Just a regular old school IPA,  nothing more, nothing less. 3.85/5",
  "Caramel, brandy, trace of smoke. This is delicate, but you know what: it tastes great. I taste üçí.",
  "Nice malt, very mellow, not overly sour, very faithful to taste.",
  "Apple. Good texture. Maybe the best-tasting one I'd had in a NEIPA in years (Old faithful, I say!). Check!",
  "Now in the can. Pretty harsh, but you get the idea. üçí üçí üíï. Nutty. Lacking a bit in personality. Still not bad.",
  "Simple... but well executed. Great mouthfeel, apple, mild, dryish. 4.15.",
  "Outstanding, up there with Merci Matthieu L. , which is hard to put my finger on. Very fruity and quite fizzy. Very fucking good üòä",
  "Not really a NEIPA, even if I‚Äôd say I prefer the ABV.",
  "Canned 1 month ago (thanks LCBO) but still holding its own. Were it fresh, surely this would be one of the good CA IPAs. 3.6",
  "Oh! This is Yummy! Creamy and surprisingly tasty, I can't wait to try it on tap!",
  "Light, fluffy, a tad tart, brandy, oak, delicate... What else? Definitely better than Lollipop. 3.6",
  "Forgot it. Refreshing, funky, inoffensive, merci beaucoup Matthieu L.",
  "Very good Brewskey, very citrusy and bitter.",
  "After almost 3 months of Galaxy, this batch is very nice.",
  "Ridiculously sweet and classic, yet it really isn't. Quite small for a 5% old school IPA. Respectable, but there is not much New Belgium can. 3.9",
  "I really get this  üçí. So nice!",
  "It‚Äôs barrelled, you guessed it, delicious! I want to buy more! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I like the taffy texture,  but also the dry hop. Pretty thin. Would prefer the pastry stout, which is quite different. 3.85",
  "I have a soft spot for Nelson Sauvin. This nectar of the gods also contains 4 other kinds of hops! And it‚Äôs got a welcome kick for a BBC üíï. 4.35, good mouthfeel, dank, citrus, tropical.  Merci Matthieu L. Renaud B.",
  "Really love this one! I am not the saison expert (they are ‚Äî I don't need my apples ‚Äî but still delicious). Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot! Such delicious sourness! Merci Vincent L.",
  "Fruit, tart, boozy, nice fruity finish, follows through.",
  "Simple gueuze with a nice peach pit taste. Hoppy, but I just wish it was a little more... organic .",
  "Almost a month old but still nice, vanilla being most powerful. I THINK I can get some vanilla out. 3.9",
  "Very mild. Gets harsher as it warms up. Merci Matthieu L. et Vincent L.",
  "Very sour, very piney. Fruity. Fruity. Very sour for a saison. Good mouthfeel. Merci Matthieu L. et... Renaud?",
  "I love that fruit, and I think this batch may be a little too citrusy).",
  "One of the best pilsners I've had. Musty!",
  "Stoutunbouchon! Nose gets better when it warms up üòã. Coffee, bourbon, chocolate, nicely balanced. Very nice, my fave from Small Pony. ‚ù§Ô∏è Small Pony!",
  "Vague hop burn. Pretty much the only consistency I've had from Maltstrom or any other similar BA. Interesting. 3.85",
  "One of their best-selling IPAs, Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Simple dark ale, nothing more than that. I can't taste it, maybe just in my head. Very old school.",
  "Look old school enough for yah? Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Oh, man! This is such good quality fruit! Treehouse is one of my fave big beer",
  "Nice mouthfeel, grapefruit. Quite acidic. A little better when warmer. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "This was bad. But you know what: I ‚ù§Ô∏è",
  "Luscious mouthfeel, lovely bourbon kick, chocolate. Really hits the spot tonight! Simon S.",
  "I agree with an Untappd friend: like a cross btw a juicy NEIPA and a saison. A little flat. Could be a tad less sour, though. Going up .25.",
  "Scrumptious candy sugar on the nose that immediately follows, followed by bitterness. As it warms up, more bitterness than sweetness, but still a nice and thin saison. Would have preferred a little more sweetness.",
  "Really nice texture, very pleasant, not my fave from Collective Arts. Quite classy.",
  "Oh shit, so nice! Best mofo I've had so far in my life. So creamy and so hazy. Amazing balance, love Auval!",
  "Coffee and chocolate. Easily the best in Quebec, quality hands-down. üíï",
  "Holy moly!üíï",

  "Simple dry ale, simple. Refreshing. Nice. 4.35 Merci Vincent L.",
  "Ah, Yummy, you've finally come out of the closet to assume your real identity: you're an IPA! l knew it all along, Baby! You're the queen!",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy. Fruity but acidic with a somewhat thin (but still fluffy) finish. I don't get the butter but I kind of sense it...",
  "Second Sip, Better than the first. Very good. Dominion-ish.",
  "Very frothy, hoppy, üçí and vanilla come out nicely. Dry finish. Very well done! 4.4, I want more!",
  "Serious DIPA, quite nice, I don't taste myself. Extra points for the Belgian. Almost 4.",
  "Coffee, sour, bitter. In the mouth, rather bitter. Almost bubbly. My fav from Small Pony. 4.35",
  "Sugar plum ü•• . A little thin, but still enjoyable and unique.",
  "Not much texture, rather fluffy. Pretty much like a grisette. 4.12/5",
  "Pretty much the best JK I've had from Small Pony. Nice bourbon and vanilla, good mouthfeel, I like it. Easy drinking. 4.35",
  "Mmmhhh! This is how I like, erh... love Nelson Sauvin! Dank, great mouthfeel, slight hop burn, kinda like a $5 stout. 4.35",
  "How could you go wrong with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy? The usual BBC class, melon, tropical fruit and an amazing mouthfeel. Another great one from the masters!",
  "Still very enjoyable, good texture, nice DDH kick. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Dry, bitter, piney, quite funky. Tasty. Refreshing. Not far from your average DC IPA, if not THE VT IPA üòú",
  "Coffee, sour, rather harsh, but also more traditional sours, which I‚Äôve never had before. To revisit this summer. 3.9/5. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very nice mouthfeel. Sweet and boozy, that's what counts. Underrated. üíï",
  "Very good NEIPA, very dry, a little something, if not quite as good as the regular one. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very drinkable.",
  "Doesn't taste like 11% ABV. Rather strange, old-school West Coast. Reminds me of Bor√©ale Double Descente.",
  "Ok malty, quite dry, cereal, citrus. Nutty but good texture. Pretty good.",
  "Batch #2. And I'm just fine with balsamic vinegar. BBC, vous autres vous l'avez, l'avez Pepsi!",
  "Mmmhhh! This is how I like, erh... love Nelson Sauvin! Delish.",
  "One of their best-rated IPAs, thanks BBC! Always a safe bet.",
  "Fruit, tart, not too bad, I like it. Still not used to.",
  "Very nice aroma. Really not bad, quite good.",
  "Fruit, tart, unexpected sourness (is it from the hops?). Intense.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot! üíï",
  "In the can, maybe because it‚Äôs aged so far (2015-2018), and because it‚Äôs suitable for the patio.",
  "Do I dig them Sticking to 2. Average mouthfeel, boozy. 3.65 but still nice. Not too far off bourbon taste-wise. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Beautiful dark yellow haze. Rather old school, piney, bitter and frothy, then creamy. Not too sweet, too bitter.",
  "Still surprisingly bad. I probably meant to say it... but I did  üò∂",
  "Easy 4.1, except... for the üçØ, which is very nice. Good mouthfeel, too. 4.15.",
  "I think this time, BTP's pretty much nailed it. Delicate, well made, well balanced. 4.4",
  "Gorgeous cherry on a good day! Up .25",
  "Harsh, but true to the style. Up .25 yet again. üíï",
  "Pretty much on point. Good texture, but as is often the case with IPAs, a little too sweet. Going up .25.",
  "Odd coffee and vanilla taste, but not very dry. Original. Refreshing.",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. The mouthfeel is ok, but I‚Äôm sure I would have bought more. Merci Matthieu L. et tarde pas √† l‚Äôenfiler",
  "Lactose, sweet, not too bitter, peppery, not too dry, very well balanced. A little bretty, not overly boozy, too sweet.",
  "Very interesting type of sour, bitter, earthy. Nice.",
  "Les thick than expected. Rather boozy, it has a nice texture. The scotch ale used isn't bad, but the Black Liquids aren't overpowering. 4.12.",
  "Oh yes! Best Bellwoods IPA I've had so far. Dank, fruity, less sweet than most, with a slightly astringent finish, the Bellwoods way. ‚ù§Ô∏è Merci mon ami Matthieu L.",
  "Easy 4.25...",
  "Very light and fluffy, just the right bitterness. Very nice!",
  "Very sour , bitter, oak. Discreet grape juice. Quite tasty! 4.35",
  "Really like the rounded tooth. Nice texture. Really good value for $. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Beets? I thought it was in the can, not sure about 4 weeks but definitely better than regular. And I'm getting to where I'm going with this üò∂",
  "I think this is my favourite P√©ch√© Mortel version.  3.9",
  "Still one of the best NEIPAs around.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Booze, cocoa and vanilla. Trace of salt. Good mouthfeel. 4.35. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Fruity, hoppy and creamy, this is boozy, but there is something I can't quite put my finger on: sugar. Not very hoppy. 4.1 Merci Vincent L.",
  "A little funky, quite malty and bitter, but I like it.",
  "Not much on the nose. Rather old school and boozy. Good mouthfeel. Not too sweet, as usual. Reminds me of English vinous, which is somewhat different. A little thin.",
  "Nice mouthfeel, almond, jam. Sweet but balanced by some bitterness. Quite nice. 4.15",
  "Very boozy Old school IPA, surprisingly boozy for this level of ABV. Good hops, but not overpowering... 3.6.",

  "Expected a little better from BBC. Nice brown ale, quite malty. Forgettable.",
  "Too sweet, but hey! This is fruit! Dank, tropical, great mouthfeel! Almost 4.25. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Coffee and sour are like cats and dogs, not a good fit. Lovely üòä",
  "Delicious, of course. Raspberry or raspberry ale, is mellower than I'd like. Quite nice, I'll look it up.",
  "Flat and rather thin, but you wouldn't know it. Pretty dry. Pretty nice.",
  "Slightly thin, quite funky, pretty interesting. Well... still pretty good, if rather conventional.",
  "Old school, just the right grape and wood. Pretty weak for an IPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Light, fluffy, a tad tart, Le cacao, slight tartness, not too bitter.",
  "In my book, the best batch so far. More julep than beer. Better than expected.",
  "Wonderful! Creamy, slightly sour, interesting dessert.",
  "Hard to find better than this. Makes me feel heavy...",

  "Meh... decent saison, no bitterness. Still cool, Borders saying...",

  "Dry, apple, bitter, not too dry. Quite tasty!",
  "A little old school. Nothing stands out. Old school, but interesting and unique.",
  "Good mouthfeel, good bitterness, coffee is quite nice.  Could be a little stronger and thicker, but I'd take a shot. 3.9",
  "Doesn't taste like 11% ABV. Rather old school. No mouthfeel, other than that, rather nice. 3.9",
  "Last time I rated it, a year ago, I actually liked it. Bor√©ale, rich and fruity. It's evanescent and glorious. Refreshing and beautiful. 4.35",
  "So good I was going to forget to take my pic. Oh well...",
  "Luscious, juicy, tropical, please your ü••!",
  "Quite boozy nose, not so much on the palate. Good bitterness, but I can tell it‚Äôs getting rather thick. Wine and vanilla pair very well. Gets the job done. 4.15",
  "Very drinkable Jutsu. Slightly bitter, not overly sweet or sour, goes down easy. Stella is very nice. 4.35",
  "Still pretty bad, despite trying 2+ times now. To the point where I'm stepping away from the bottle. Not my thing.",
  "Oh! This is serious stuff! IPA night! At least 4.5!",
  "It's got the Bellwoods nose, but a slight coconut touch to it. Good texture. Blend with ros√© is interesting, but nothing more.",
  "Another decent stout, I think this is underwhelming considering the ABV. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I think Messorem is the best PA I've ever tasted. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Honest stout, not hugely hoppy, but still a serious brew. Refreshing, sexy. Venerable, though I half expected worse. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "This is very good, not too sour, if not the hoppy, at least in my book. Gros merci Marie-Christine et Matthieu L.",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. Yeah! 3.9",
  "At 5.5%, bang for buck! Excellent quality hops, especially for a single-hop brew. Quite pleasant. All-around good. 4.35",
  "A little short in the mouthfeel department but pretty good on the palate. Not too bad.",
  "üçí and tropics. Quite subtle, yet delicious. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Maple at 1st, bitter and malty but not overly strong or thin. Quite nice.",
  "I think they lowered the ABV somewhat, since most people don't perceive anything wrong with it. Still nice.",
  "Light, fluffy, a tad tart, Nelson Sauvin...",
  "Rather bitter, I like my kriek thicker and sweeter. Good texture. Citrusy and a little bitter, but still a very good APA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very good, from the start. You can tell it's going to get a little tired...",
  "Low-key blonde, not overly complex, sweet, not too boozy, not overly sweet.",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, but ok if only Sabro is great.",
  "Pleasantly surprised. Fruity West Coast. Reminds me of... ü•æ",

  "Fruit... Oh! What a bitch! The best porter I've had from Small Pony. Oh! What a Beautiful Day!",
  "The best KBS I've had. To think that a while ago, we tried it on tap (yes, fresh) and it's still one of the best!",
  "I like it better than Jam Hands. Very tropical and hazy, but less sweet than expected. That being said, it's definitely better than Starring. I'm not complaining, just saying...",
  "Sweet, quite dry, not unlike Picnic Blanket (Dominion) or even Pilsner! Tickles the throat üòã . . . ?",
  "üçí üçí üçí üç∑. Dry finish. Excellent!",
  "You know, for me, this is pretty fucking good üòñ",
  "So good I was going to forget to take my pic. So good I thought. Yummy! Loaded with tart fruit, it deserves our all-time favorite GLB! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Sweet, delicate, not for the faint of heart, and not for the faint of mind. Quite nice.",
  "Straddles the boundary btw OS IPA and NEIPA. Very nice!",
  "Rather bitter, I like the tingling on the tongue. A little thin, but I like it.",
  "Well, I guess, summer... Lacking a bit of its tropical hop burn, but otherwise great.",
  "Honest stout, light caramel taste, that's the thin way to tell it's food-safe. Fruity, but I expected more.",
  "5 month old can. OS is very light, but it does have a nice hop bill.  Yummy!",
  "Decent IPA. I would mistake this for a reality show...",
  "Not that familiar with the style, but it does get better. Nice NEIPA, not the most complex hops, yet well rounded. 4.15",
  "Rather fruity, I think this is my favourite Cascade IPA from Small Pony. Very nice mouthfeel. 4.3",
  "This is like going back to when I discovered HF (Abner & Harlan) and P√©ch√© was my first fave. Nice roundness and balance. 4.15",
  "So sour. Some tingling on the tongue. Very well done.",
  "Mmmmhhhhhh!!! The most delicious I've had.",

  "Rather bitter, the cinnamon isn't overbearing. It does the job, too.  Merci Vincent L.",
  "Batch #8, still awesome, though a little thin this time. Going up to 4.",
  "Nice fruit, but not too sour. And you know what? It tastes great.",
  "Le cacao, my God! Now they call it a NEIPA! Great mouthfeel, tropical, should‚Äôve gotten more than one can.",
  "Still very good, though... not the most tropical IPA, maybe because it's hazy and saison.",
  "Rather boozy, it works. Love the way it was shot. Up .25",
  "Canned June 2nd, 2018. Still holding its own. Good little stout, pretty good for the price.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Pilsner saison have! Intense, maybe a tad too bitter...",
  "Good tart, would taste like time saving va so easy. Reminds me of Le Cheval blanc in the late 80's (MTL's oldest brewpub).",
  "In your face at first. Nice. Nice.",
  "More raspberries than expected, expected a little more intense. Very good!",
  "Used to be my favorite. Still very good today.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very old school, but not as bad as expected. Old school as usual. Good NEIPA, though. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Coffee and chocolate forward, while at the same time not overbearing. Very good mouthfeel.",
  "Midwest coast, always an option. Merci Renaud B.",
  "TIL Willamette & Sterling are masters in that department. And this is the best one I've had from them.",
  "Not that bad, but Not that good, either. Reminds me of Nickel Brook's Headstock, only stronger",

  "Not bad, maybe not in the extreme, but well made and tasty. Berliner than expected. 4.35",
  "Always nice, tonight üçí? Similar to P√©ch√© mortel. OK.",
  "Medium fluffy, hazy, hoppy, definitely has the California twist. Very nice!",
  "Subtle mosaic, a little astringent. Probably tastes more Bourbon than Bourbon... Still delicious...",
  "Good texture, nice bourbon kick, and for once, a hint of pineapple. The tamest Los T, somewhat hazy APA.",
  "Aggressive hop blast. The Bellwoods signature is always fresh.",
  "Juicy, of course. Fruit, oak, delicate. Toffee. Toffee. Very, very, very, very good!",
  "Amazing üçí nose, very tropical. Barrel is present but not overwhelming. Quite enjoyable. 4.15",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy. Fruity, prunes, tropical. Really good.",
  "What a great start! They now say are the true LCBO stouts. Not bad.",
  "Never tasted before. Pleasant, sweet and old school. Almost 4.25. Very well done.",
  "Maple and some vanilla. More bitter than expected (too much roasting IMO). Decent mouthfeel. Pretty good, if not the best JK I've had. 4.15",
  "Last night. So meh...",
  "Not much texture, faint cognac presence. Its a .25, not very good, but still a very good quality beer.",
  "The typical Messorem hop bite: üçç, Nelson Sauvin, Honey, Citra. Thin, but tasty.",
  "Good coffee, and not too much vanilla. Ok.",
  "Pleasantly surprised. Fruity West Coast, yah!",
  "Seems a little thinner than I recall, but still... loads of delicious fruit. Laser tag added. 4.35",
  "Expected a more restrained BA stout, which is not the case with this one. West Coast, great hop burn and texture.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Not very fizzy, not very rich or sour, it doesn't disappoint on the palate. Quite nice, not the most complex, yet well-balanced.",
  "Nice English-style amber. Not their specialty.",
  "Odd coffee and vanilla taste, but not too strong, about 4.5",

  "Such a good old school IPA!",
  "Almost happy to find this at Nord-Est, very good texture, sweet and peachy. Promising!",
  "Scrumptious candy sugar on the nose which follows on the mouth. Some grapefruit and bitterness. Quite sweet, somewhat boozy, to be sipped slowly. Gros merci Matthieu L.",

  "Coffee and vanilla. Very nice. Really hits the spot with this DIPA. These guys are masters!",
  "Batch. Nose is Pop-Tarts. Tropical. Good mouthfeel. Almost 4.25. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Happy to try it on tap rather than having to buy a whole bottle. British style indeed. Makes me feel more British. KBS.",
  "Nice barrel. Less harsh than most other LTM Baltic releases, a little more barrelly, but that's to be expected from a 2 (or 3) month-old IPA.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Very good mouthfeel, dank, tropical. Not as strong as I remember, methinks. 4.15",
  "This is a very good basic (non barrel aged) stout: rich chocolate and coffee and pretty darn good mouthfeel. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Really interesting sour, merlot and white wine. Lovely!",
  "Very nice mouthfeel. Sour, quite bretty. Very good for the price. Nice!",
  "Nose is a little sulphurous. Nice üçí. Mouthfeel OK. 3.9. Merci Matthieu L.",

  "Nice barrel, tropical notes not unlike Picnic Blanket (Dominion) or even Solstice d'√©t√© (DDC). Interesting.",
  "Simple little sour IPA, quite nice. Nice mouthfeel. Not too shabby, I don't mind Uranus üòú",
  "Nice Bourbon nose. Sweet but not overly. Very thin.",
  "A trip back in time. HAPPY NEW YEAR!",
  "One of the first BBC IPAs. Not their specialty.",
  "Not the best stout, but hey, respect!",
  "Lime burst mellowed out by vanilla and lactose. Very enjoyable and original. Yummy (and maybe a little sweet).",
  "Amazing nose, very tropical and boozy. Similar to a Jester King (or something similar). I think they overdid it. Too sweet.",
  "Oh! This is so good!",
  "Not much flavour, not much mouthfeel. Good bet. Straight away, though... ü§î",
  "Grapefruity, quite dry. Quite sweet, but oatmeal does the trick. Great balance.  3.9",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy. Slight plastic, pale yellow aftertaste.",
  "Good mouthfeel, boozier than regular Connexion. This is good, at 11.5%, better than I had just before.",
  "The most drinkable blanc in that name, too. Reminds me of Le Cheval blanc in the late 80's (MTL's oldest brewpub).",
  "I think this is the best Galaxy I've had so far in a can. Very fruity, almost sour.",
  "Love that taffy nose, love the way it tastes down in the mouth, then again, in the mouth, well, mouth, too bad it didn't taste that good on tap. Slight oak presence. OK, not really a NEIPA, but still a great hop bill. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Typical BTP nose. Good bourbon and coffee balance. Quite nice, but rum is too intense. I don't taste balsamic vinegar. Ok, a little weak... 3.9",
  "Serious DIPA, very light and almost no grapefruit. Very nice. Discreet Bourbon!",
  "Simple from the get-go, but nice saison-ish texture. Wish it were thicker.",
  "Thick, tart, rather harsh, not a style I'm familiar with, probably because of Connexion. Sour üçí? Sorry, no pickcha. Yet again, disappointingly thin. 3.85.",
  "Simple pale ale, simple as that. Lovely mosaic nose. Lovely mosaic on the palate. Less flat and sweet than expected. Still very nice, if not the most complex  üçí available. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Scrumptious candy sugar on the nose which follows on the palate. Some grapefruit and bitterness. Quite sweet, somewhat boozy, to be sipped slowly. Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "I think it‚Äôs my favourite Cantillon, it may be rounded a little for a less refined iteration. Still a great dessert, if not the best one so far. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice mouthfeel, green. Really hits the spot as well! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Smoky, but good mouthfeel. Nice DIPA. Merci Alas! üçí! üíï",
  "Simple pils, delicious  ‚òïÔ∏è  ‚òïÔ∏è. Chocolate, coffee and vanilla. Good!",
  "Nice fruit, delicate, not as tropical as expected. Pleasant. 4.15",
  "Frrooty-frrooty! Very fruity (citrus, apricot, candy sugar). Really nice balance. Could be a little less sweet, but the combination brings out the amazing Cantillon DNA. 4.12",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad! 4.25 if you don't mind the French. Yummy!",
  "Fruity, fruity and acetic, could be thicker, but it does have a nice texture. Happy to share it!",
  "Beets? I thought it was in the can, not that fresh. Hard to tell from the bottle. Different...",
  "You can't have too little texture for its famous BB...",
  "Nice raspberry nose, follows through. Sweet but not overly sweet. Complex.",
  "Dry, bitter, hibiscus, üçí, oak. Rather dry. Reminiscent of weak batch from previous PA. Still lovely, would be more enthused in the summer. Merci Matthieu L. et... Renaud?",
  "Really dig The Grand Marnier üí•. So sweet and comes back to reality ü§î Nelson Sauvin ü•∞ . A beautiful new single hop, very tropical and nice funk. Almost dessert. 4.35 üí•",
  "Luscious mouthfeel, lovely bourbon kick, chocolate. Really hits the spot tonight! As good as previous batch.",
  "I think this time, BTP's pretty much nailed it. Harsh, crude, not for the faint of heart, but still an exceptional NEIPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "A little spiced, quite nice. Very fruity. Well balanced. Citrus.",
  "Very good definition of good beer!",
  "Ah, why not, good old Sunsplit, great hop burn, boozy, tropical. üíïüíï Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Odd coffee and vanilla taste, but not much mouthfeel. Nice.",
  "First time in a can. One of my fave Bellwoods IPAs. Dank, not too sweet or sour, true to the style, not too complex. Delish!",
  "Wow! Love it. Great dessert! Better than expected. Amazing mouthfeel, yummy! Merci Renaud B.",
  "Not bad, good pepper, if only a little broken in vanilla. Mmmmhhhhhh!!! Dat üëÑ",
  "Refreshing. Sweet. Very nice.",
  "Not big on fast food, but this is one of their best-rated IPAs. OK mouthfeel.",
  "Nice hops, tropical, quite bitter.",
  "I think they overdid it. Too much bergamot, too bitter and bitter and ultimately tastes as if it's roasting out in the open. Better luck next time.",
  "Enticing nose which only partly follows through on palate. Honey, vanilla, cinnamon, vanilla and almond. Quite sweet, but not overly sweet. For the price, would make for a great summer beer. Merci Vincent L.",
  "Not very dry, not as thin as I would have liked. Lovely bourbon and vanilla balance. Very good mouthfeel. 4.15. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Wood, wood, is subtle. All right.",
  "Probably the queen in this new king. Quick, sweet, not too boozy, dry finish. Almost too good! If only it had this much ABV! Merci beaucoup Renaud B.",
  "Definitely less sweet than I remember.",
  "Surprisingly thin, which doesn't say much.",
  "WOW! What a nice addition to Moutere!",
  "Rather bitter, not very sweet. Still very enjoyable. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Simple bourbon sip, very nice. Pretty good, if rather conventional.",
  "Nice fruit, moderate sourness, not much pucker, finish, this  Mixtape is it. 3.9/5 Gros merci S√©bastien B. et Renaud B. ... et Matthieu L.",
  "Honest stout, alright. Could be a little weak, but still a very good stout. I prefer Vin orange.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Kind of white, raspberry comes out nicely, but weak and tired and a tad bland.",
  "The most underrated Hypa, the weakling in the line-up. Fresh can, could have more mouthfeel, but a mite less enticing. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Honest stout. Color is probably off, not as saturated as I remember.",
  "Free from the brewer. Quite frothy. OK mouthfeel. 3.9",
  "Fruit brings a touch of personality. Traditional, but refreshing.",
  "Not so much on the nose. Fruity and citrusy, but less creamy than expected. Still lovely.",
  "You know, for the price, really. 4.4",
  "Nice grisette, dessert üçí and vanilla are nice. Very delicate, yet delicious. Merci Simon L.",
  "Not great, but not as bad as expected. Good mouthfeel. 4.20.",
  "Gusher... refreshing and dryish, but I can barely taste their hops. Good hop combination. But tastes a little cheap. Merci Matthieu L. & Vincent L.",
  "Second draft. Comfort zone. Nice collab with BBC. Yummy! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Don't get much fruit on any of their lambics. Nothing particularly stands out. What else? Reminds me of Auval's Chardonnay. 4.12",
  "As good as expected from Dominion. Tropical hop bite, but the dry hop comes through more in the mouth. Ceci n'est pas une gueuze, mais presque?",
  "Fruit juice, lactose, vanilla, bitter üçé, boozy üçí.",
  "Last time I rated it, a year ago, I still would have rated it higher. Still great, the coffee is lovely and the drink is surprisingly light. Well... still...",
  "Some mouthfeel... somehow, l side is a little stingy. I may have had too much of the previous batch.",
  "Coffee, slight caramel, follows through on the palate. Well, almost. You know, things often seem better in your history. 3.6",
  "Watered down fruit, not the most tropical APA, but hey! It‚Äôs a style I‚Äôve never had before.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Easily the best gueuze I've had. Nice saison, slight hop burn, it‚Äôs got something to it. üíïüíï",
  "Seriously ‚ù§Ô∏è",
  "To be frank Zappa üçØ...",
  "The scotch, the pepper, the nutty side. Well done, Portland, great mouthfeel.",
  "What a mouthfeel! Nice sour DIPA, more sour than you think. Not too sickening! üòúWhat a mouthfeel! Nice sour DIPA, just boring...",
  "Some piney aftertaste, pretty dry. Nothing to stand out by. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Oh, DIPA! Fruity, hoppy, refreshing, very well balanced!",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy. Fruity but acidic with a somewhat mineral finish. I don't get the butter but I kind of sense it...",
  "Really nice texture, nice",
  "Cutest name! Creamy, delicate, delicious. Lovely üòä",
  "Nice mouthfeel, oak's nice.  Merci Antoine L.",
  "Very creamy, quite boozy, a tad of wood. Quite nice. Well done!",
  "A little old school. Nothing particularly stands out. Hopefully, North American-style of IPA. 3.6.",
  "Fruity... berries, not too bitter, and a touch of coconut... I think it‚Äôs my favourite porter I‚Äôve had. Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very frothy, really intense, bubbly, with a great bitterness. Sweet, but typical Dominion honey could give it's own punch. Merci Simon L. & Vincent L.",
  "Not great, but pretty good.",
  "Nice brown ale, not too malty, slight caramel and fruit. Well balanced and hoppy, which I always expect from a BTP.",
  "On my 2nd Trillium tick, pretty salty and bb tastes as if it were candy, but still: vinous. At 8.5%, can't go down. Very good stuff!",
  "The coffee is very present, but not too strong. Too sweet, but not too much. Beautiful!",
  "Excellent mouthfeel, as usual for Badlands. This one‚Äôs a can, so be on the generous side and order more!",
  "I think the dust is probably less fresh than this. Nice texture. OK mouthfeel. Decent.",
  "Old-school taste. Bitter aftertaste that lets you down.",
  "Still one of the very best pale ales around. Great saturation and finish. A real treat.",
  "Fruit on the nose, then turns to sweet caramel and spices, then to maple. Really nice, smell is just awesome (juice from the grand lode)",
  "Harsh, but you know what you get. üçí, especially for a sour. A little astringent. Would be more enthused on a hot summer day. Merci Matthieu L. et... Renaud B.",
  "Luscious mouthfeel, lovely bourbon kick, chocolate. Really hits the spot when you're following the bottle...",
  "A little old school. No harshness, just a very nice mouthfeel. Worth screwing around with the first time.",
  "Decent little imperial stout, forward thinking in every respect. Kicks ass!",
  "Oh, drop that! üçç dropped that great! Gros merci Simon L.",
  "Nice oak and strawberry, but the mouthfeel is a little nondescript. Definitely upping it.",
  "Excellent mouthfeel, as usual for Badlands. This one isn't the most fragrant and aromatic, though. Delicate peach and melon. 4.15 for a NEIPA.",
  "Sugar nose üëÑ",
  "#Delish! Amazing mouthfeel, crazy dose of brett and barrel (they shut down the tap access date 6 months ago).",
  "Dry hop juice, dry (almost) mouthfeel. Slight plastic, not very complex. I don't get the coconut taste or the coconut sugar taste. Pretty nice.",
  "Coffee and vanilla. Pretty good. One of their best releases so far. 4.6!",
  "Seems a little more flat. Good mouthfeel, otherwise, great as is, it‚Äôs an all-around good APA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Better than last batch. Passion fruit & üçí. Dry finish. All around great. our very rare can.",
  "On the sweet side. Very accessible. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Excellent mouthfeel, as usual for Badlands. This one isn't the most fragrant and aromatic, though. A little thin. 4.15/5",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. The mouthfeel is there, though. 4.15. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Dry, earthy and a little boozy, tropical. Very good mouthfeel. 4.2",
  "Woody, refreshing, not too dry, slightly vinous. Gets better as it warms up.",
  "Trace of blackberry. Slightly bitter, not very sour. Interesting. Merci Matthieu L. et... Renaud?",
  "Doesn't taste like 7% ABV. Maybe more like 9% ABV. Nice scotch ale.",
  "Nice fruit, mild acidity as expected from Dominion. Mouthfeel OK, rather dry, but I expected more.",
  "Ah, Yummy, you've finally come out of the closet to assume your real identity: you're an Oniony!",
  "Thin, dank, juicy. Citrusy and a little bitter for a West-Coast IPA. Western-leaning NEIPA. 3.85",
  "There is something sickening about the texture and consistency of L'enfer, which I somewhat respect. Creamy, fluffy, cereal, goes down when the lumps get better. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Basically a Galaxy again, almost as good as the honig, with a different fruit and a different texture. üíïüíï Merci Simon L.",
  "That coffee comes out well... and smells great. Nice outside offering. Almost 4.",
  "Love the mouthfeel, the rich coffee and roasted malt (and maybe a trace of coconut). So smooth! 4.4",
  "I love those sour cherries, and this one seems a little less sweet than previously sipped. A solid IPA.",
  "Very nice, good bitterness and hop burn, but a little thin. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very nice, good mouthfeel, not as malty as I remember.",
  "Smoked coffee! More porter than fruit, more carbonation than expected, but still a great stout. 4.35/5",
  "Doing quality control on my survival stash. Check! As great as ever! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Forgot about that one. Still amazing.",
  "Good mouthfeel, slightly tart, coffee, right out of the can. One of their good ones. 4.2/5",
  "Luscious mouthfeel, nice bb but not overly boozy, almost boozy, rather boozy. Very nice. 4.35. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Yet another delicious British IPA. Typical BTP sour, unfortunately. Overly sour for a non-BA IPA. English stuff. But still a great summer beer. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Really nice texture, nice  üçí, but the mouthfeel is a little malty, quite dry. I don't get much zest...",
  "It's got a little more bite than expected, but still an interesting vegetable and fruit presence. 4.5.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot! üíïüíï Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice fruit, good balance of tartness and carbonation. Quite nice.",
  "Not very complex, but well made. Good balance, consistency is definitely there. 3f is very nice.",
  "I feel I got hit by a train. Some old-school/West Coast DIPA! Respectable, though...",
  "Whisky √† la West Coast. Certainly not as good as many of their #1 releases. üíØ",
  "A little old school, but scotch is so nice! Coffee, very nice texture, but as it warms up, tastes a little thin. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Seems to have more bite than #GiT, maybe not as sweet as I remember, but tasty nonetheless. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Mmmmhhhhhh!!! NEIPA from the same series. Very light, not as classic as in the 80's, yet it has a nice texture for a light saison.  4.12",
  "Refreshing, nice GLB, nice bourbon nose, not too sour, not too dry. Almost a NEIPA... 4.15. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Luscious chocolate, nice üå∂ touch, not too sour, refreshing... my fave from Small Pony. 4.4.. And I've got an extra bottle üòú",
  "I think it‚Äôs my favourite JK.  Merci Renaud B., Matthieu L.",
  "Really interesting texture, some dank and some dank... A great go-to coffee stout.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Easily the best creation from Collective Arts. Creamy mango, passion fruit, candy heat, good mouthfeel. Merci Patrick C.",
  "Hazelnut, chocolate, cocoa, but above all, bourbon. Delicious üòä",
  "Wonderful orange DIPA, very delicate and delicate. Some resin... and a little bitterness. Pretty good!",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb... refreshing too! Very smooth, tropical.",
  "Simple dry hazy, rather traditional, I guess I'm accustomed to NEIPAs. This one is my favourite so far.",
  "Always nice, sure bet. Dry, dank, Sabro, juicy.  3.9",
  "Quite boozy nose. Not that tropical or sour, but pretty darn drinkable...",
  "Very good old school IPA, nothing grand, just a good old school DIPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Not bad, good coffee taste, but thinnish, like a coffee stout. I don't get the oats. 3.85, around 4.5",
  "Nice little saison, a bit hoppier than I'd like. Tastes like candy.",
  "Solid DIPA.",
  "In the can, maybe because it doesn't smell that good, duh!",
  "Good raspberry, balsamic, quite dry. Strong but good.",
  "Sticking to 1 month cans. Pretty drinkable. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "High coffee, decent fat content, chocolate and vanilla. Boozy. Were it warmer, it probably wouldn't taste that bad. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Wood in mouth. Sweet, but thin. Pretty good, decent, short on finish.",
  "Typical Monogamy, right? Up .25",
  "In my opinion, the best DIPA from Belgium. Very fruity, that's all there is to it! 4.35/5",
  "Very nice, great texture, very good, but oh so thin!",
  "Very sweet and malty, much harsher than expected, but still very good.",
  "Pleasant bourbon taste, bitter, refreshing. Reminds me of Small Pony. 4.13. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Not that uninteresting that I wouldn't mind refusing to try it again. Very good, but I'd prefer it less extravagant. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Rather sweet, I think it's more than a little true. Dry finish.  Some people prefer it other because it's hoppy. OK, that's all I'm about it.",
  "Citra and Simcoe, tropical, dank, sharp, has more than a little bit of kiwi bite. Mouthfeel OK for this low ABV. Coarse, but well made.",
  "Very mellow and lovely. More hops for a saison. Less harsh. Probably should have had more hops for a KBS. Merci Matthieu L.  Matthieu L.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very light, definitely a beach beer. Slightly hoppy, a great intro to the style. Rose? No, it's not. 3.6",
  "This is very good, I taste the bourbon, but would rarely buy this in a real establishment.",
  "Canned 1 month ago, so it could be fresher. Nice.",
  "Not very complex, but well made. Unique.",
  "Gusher, fragrant Day One. Well balanced, delicate chocolate, trace of vanilla, good acidity. Good choice for a sunny, wet winter afternoon. 4.1/5. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Watered down apple juice. Nice.",
  "Very smooth, creamy, medium-low acidity. Not harsh, just saying. Merci Matthieu L. Antoine C. and Matthieu L. . Nuance!",
  "Typical British-style pale ale, Chocolate Brown, rather bitter and malty. Nice mouthfeel, even if there is no chocolate. I wouldn't drink it on tap, as it's not in the can. 4.12.",
  "This is very good, dank, slightly sour, not too \"Peach\" dry. Very easy drinking, would never drink this with a sour saison. 4.2",
  "Not great, but pretty damned to be ahead. Must contain Peach and Jutsu. One of their best. 4.4",
  "Last time I rated it, a year ago, I rated it barely. But it's getting better. Wouldn't it also be awesome without it?",
  "It's got the Bellwoods nose üòä. Has the Malty claim, but I wouldn't hesitate to call it that. Pretty sweet, but not overly sweet.",
  "Canned 1 month ago, so it could be fresher. Still very nice, it's got that \"pioneer\" NEIPA taste. Nice mouthfeel. 4.35",
  "Nice peach, very light and almost no harshness. Quite smooth. A great JK üë†",
  "Very nice, excellent hop bill and texture. I dig .25",
  "Simple, refreshing, nothing to it. Lovely...",
  "Very dank, good mouthfeel, good hop burn, just bitter enough... quite British!",
  "Expected a little better from BBC, better than most IPA du Nord-Est batches of late. Good balance of honey, hop burn, tropical fruit. üíïüíï",
  "Batch #9, just awesome. You know what you get. üçí, coffee, chocolate, well, bourbon, apricot and vanilla. Impressive!",
  "Smells like dessert üòúMassive  chocolate attack. Really good texture. Peachy, nice bourbon touch, though the vanilla is too thick. Pretty good!",
  "Still one of the best NEIPAs around.   Merci Simon L.",
  "Honest stout, not as saturated as others. Fruity, not overly sour or bretty, just well balanced. 4.12",
  "I like these apples, fruity and tart, kind of like the tart I just have in my fridge. 4.35",
  "Very malty, a nice bourbon touch and finish. Very good mouthfeel. Well balanced. Merci Patrick C.",
  "Odd coffee and vanilla taste, but pretty refreshing on the nose. Interesting.",
  "Simple cold brew. Pretty sour, not that complex, yet nice. Frothy AF.",
  "Yet another delicious from OH. Guests really gets a free hot dog üò≥",
  "Rather thick, dank, juicy with a little something different aftertaste. Citrusy and a little bitter, but pleasant nonetheless. I don't know this style well enough.",
  "I think it‚Äôs my favourite Pop Galaxy from their line-up. Very fruity, very interesting. Tangerine stands out more than rhubarb. A treat!",
  "Simple unsweetened chocolate, very nice, nice... quite nice. I love it! ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è4.35",
  "Very sour, quite boozy. Very old school, but wouldn't mind buying it again.",
  "Light, fluffy, malty, slightly fruity. Great saison!",
  "Doing a couple more times now. Maple syrup and üçé better!!!",
  "Good mouthfeel, creamy, quite bitter. Could be a little stronger and thicker, but I wouldn't hesitate. 4.15",
  "A trip back in time. Pretty nice old school IPA, like a Head Stock on steroids. Didn't expect a NEIPA, and it ain't. 3.9.",
  "Very mild, delicate raspberries, apparently more lager than IPA. Interesting, but I prefer my IPAs not sour.",
  "Almost a month old but still lovely fruit. Can't say it's my fave. Still a little raw.",
  "Not bad, but Somewhat watery. I was expecting more jam. Will try later in crowler.",
  "A little disappointing given the price and the expectation. Lacks roundness. Still 3.85",
  "Very good mouthfeel, tropics, fruity. I'd buy this to treat. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "My first Galaxy (üçç). Pretty sour, not West Coast. Ok.",
  "Canned 2+ months ago, so it could get a little better. Still very good, quality shit. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Fruit, tart, citrusy, kind of old-school IPA. Didn't expect a West-Coast IPA, never had and still drink it, even after all this time. 3.7",
  "Now you're talking! Great mouthfeel, nice color, nice hop bill & hop bill! Delicate IPA! Better than most IPA du Nord-Est batches of late. As good as many Hypa versions. 4.3",
  "Dry mouthfeel, delicate hops, sour üçí, bitter, nondescript hops. Don't know how they did it, but they were great. Would prefer the original anyway. Merci Matthieu L. et... Vincent L.",
  "Not bad, but Somewhat watery. I was expecting more jam. Would be great on a hot summer day. 3.85",
  "Quite nice, but a little thin. Too much juice and metallic taste. Good, but nothing stands out. Just a trace.\"",
  "Fruit, tart, unexpected sourness. Not sure if it's just been sitting in my fridge or if it's been taken out, disappointing.",
  "Raspberry juice, comes right out of the can. Pretty acidic, though. Kinda like inside Bor√©ale IPA. Refreshing. Approved.",
  "I love the raspberry, but what I'm tasting, is not as good as out-of-this-world Rum. Good BA stout, but this one is my favourite so far. 4.15",
  "A little flat, but not quite as much as I remember, it‚Äôs a pale ale, not as raspberries-ish as I remember.",
  "Well, Stray Dog isn't my thing, but I like it anyway...",
  "It's a porter, not a stout. It's awfully thin for this kind of style, but it's close. Good texture. British-style.",
  "Nice mouthfeel, tropical, quite good. 4.15. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "What a dessert! Coffee, chocolate and bourbon take over. Not too shabby!",
  "Low carbonation, but still good. This is my 2nd old can! Going up to 4.",
  "Batch #6, still pretty dank, some funk, slight caramel taste, not overly complex. 4.1. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Oats on the nose. Scrumptious candy, but also burnt sugar and vanilla. Pleasant. Notes of chocolate and cinnamon. Nice.",
  "Batch #4, just awesome. You know what you get.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Subtle mosaic-ish, quite frothy. You know what you get. Nice.",
  "Very mild, delicate chardonnay. Quite enjoyable.",
  "Good mouthfeel, pale ale, salt is nice. On the nose, you can tell the fruit is there. On the palate, you can't always get enough of these guys!",
  "Not much to it, maybe should have had it first.... Remember it to be better.",
  "As stupid and old-school as they say. Boozy, Belgian, tropical. Not as tropical as some other DIPAs around, but still an excellent NEIPA.",
  "Smoky, but not overdone. Great mouthfeel. Comfort on a cool, wet spring day. Quite satisfying üíï",
  "Very sour for LTM. Batch seems thinner, but one can't help but feel that it‚Äôs holding up quite a bit better than before.",
  "In my opinion, the best Cantillon I've had.",
  "Rather fruity, I‚Äôd say more dry than Gambrinus.",
  "Very mild, just sour cherries üçí and vanilla, but not overly sour either. Very nice!",
  "Batch #7, still awesome, although a little thin this time. Going up .25.",
  "Very dank & tropical, not overly complex. Not really expected this much potential, the guys at BTP!",
  "Very nice on the nose. Fruit... not as fruity or complex as I remember.",
  "Very similar to regular Old school IPA. No mouthfeel, just a great hop bill and hop burn. I'd buy this again,  if it weren't so awesome...",
  "Really nice texture, very well made. Thanks Moka!",
  "Surprisingly thick for a 9% stout. Tasty on the nose, but a little thin.",
  "Quite fruity, quite peppery. Delicious!",
  "I love Chocolate. But this is the best one I've had in a can. 3.9",
  "Smoked candy.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot! One of the best JKs! Just the perfect oatmeal saison! 4.6",
  "Mmmhhh... very good!",
  "Mmmmhhhhhh!!! Another good NEIPA, just as good as the first one. One of the best ones I've had from Bellwoods. Trillium, rhubarb and wine. 4.35 üíï Merci Simon L.",
  "Nice mouthfeel, lemon and funk. Discreet Bourbon. Very mild for a single stout. Merci Vincent L.",
  "Les thick and rich and boozy Gros merci Simon!",
  "Apple. Really not bad, if not the most complex OG out there. Good balance. Great brewery, they‚Äôre always a plus!",
  "Amazing raspberry taste, but not what you expect from a grape growing brew. Quite sweet, yet refreshing.",
  "Simple stout, nothing more than that. Pretty good, malty, malty, malty. Honest coffee and vanilla. Good mouthfeel. 4.15",
  "Not that familiar with the style, but this one is the best I've had ever.",
  "A little old school, but enough to get my buck. 3.6",
  "Not very complex, but well made. Lovely.",
  "Mmmmhhhhhh!!! Me gusta ron!!! Nice mouthfeel, sweet and luscious, slightly tart, refreshing!",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot! Ha smooth AF! 4.35",
  "A trip back in time. Good old school IPA.",
  "Nice stout, pleasant double finish. Pretty good, if rather conventional.",
  "Apple candy, not sure which version I prefer. Old school, yet refreshing and tickles the tongue. Almost sweet.",
  "Awesome DIPA, very tropical. The tortilla taste is there, but is it really? Boozy. It's obvious from the mouth. But it's getting better...",
  "Never tasted before. Pleasant, sweet and old school. Very pleasant.",
  "Meh... it ain't great.",
  "Very nice, good mouthfeel, delicate, not as rich as I expected. 3.9",
  "Low acidity and bitterness, some salt, good mouthfeel. Very good, great üíï",
  "The best British-style IPA I've tasted so far from West. Thick, bitter, tropical, should‚Äôve gotten more than one can. Merci Matthieu L. , quaranti√®me encore!",
  "Light, fluffy and thirst-quenching at first, but it gets slightly better in the mouth. Bourbon, vanilla and (welcome) the Splendid DIPA. This is good!",
  "Great mouthfeel, wild. Not very complex, but better than Bas-Canada. Yummy. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very good IPA, very fragrant (not a NEIPA, not even close), rather bitter, definitely has a tongue-tingling taste, which I can live with. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I think this is the best PA I've had, and probably would have had it if it wasn't so sweet.  Yeah, 3.85",
  "Surprisingly thin for ABV (10.3%). Dark chocolate comes out well. Small for a Single IPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Happy to try it on tap instead of having to buy a whole bottle. Slight oak, and that‚Äôs about it.",
  "Batch #7, still awesome, although a little thin this time. Looking forward to the next one!",
  "üçí üçí üçí ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è Maybe a little green still. Really nice.",
  "As good as expected from Dominion. Tropical, hazy, dank. Very well done.",
  "Easy 4.1, easy triple IPA!",
  "Holy moly! Tropical spice! Delicious! So delicious I could sip on my own! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad! One-dimensional (or is it one-directional?), though! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "A little meh. Still nice, but Messorem's NEIPAs are much better. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Simple oats with a nice texture. Thin and not quite as strong as last batch. Well balanced and tasty. 4.15",
  "Canned 1 month ago, so it could be fresher. Still nice, you know what I mean. Good texture.",
  "Bretty, raspberries, bitter and watery, rather bitter, refreshing, though with a certain alcohol and bitterness. Discreet Bourbon. 4.12",
  "Sticking to 4. Average mouthfeel, boozy. But still good.  Merci Matthieu L. Bor√©ale Bor√©ale. 4.1",
  "Just a regular old school IPA with a nice twist. I always love the small bottles though.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "In the BBC, not so much on the palate, but on the palate. Quite nice. Some acidity, quite dry. I like it. Boozy. Nice hops.",
  "Nice hops, tropical, nice hop burn, not too dry. Not too tropical.",
  "Still very drinkable julep. Dry, citrusy, boozy. Pretty good.",
  "Oh lala! One of the best Hypas! Merci Renaud B.",
  "Not that bad, if not most.",
  "Luscious coconut, lovely mouthfeel, slightly vinous. Very good. Would have preferred more mouthfeel. Would have bought more.",
  "Surprisingly smooth, I was expecting something harsher from Messorem. Nice.",
  "More sour than expected. Candy, lemon, lime, vanilla. Lovely.",
  "Surprisingly thin for ABV (10.3%). Dark chocolate comes forward, hazelnut & bourbon are more discrete. Good, though I had much worse before.",
  "Seems to have more bite than #GiT, maybe not as ‚Äúperfect‚Äù (Strata to blame here???), but delicious nonetheless nonetheless. Delish!",
  "Not much on the nose. However, it gets smoother in the mouth. Pretty good, pretty sure I'll try more.",
  "Now you're talking! Great mouthfeel, super dry hop, tropics, üëÖ! Gros merci S√©bastien B. ü•∞",
  "Quite boozy nose, not very fruity. Not much aftertaste.",
  "Batch #7, still amazing for this underwhelming OG. As good as previous one, thanks Tyson S.",
  "The best JK I've ever had. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Must-have!",
  "Surprisingly thin. Shifting to a taster just in time for Halloween. Almost dessert. One of the big banana yummy breweries in Ontario. A classy treat.",
  "Frothy bright red üçí. Almost sickeningly sweet. Pretty solid.",
  "Very sour, very piney. Quite pleasant.",
  "Bitter and funky, reminds me of Filibuster. Refreshing.",
  "Nice can.",
  "Rum, raisins, caramel, just dry-ish enough, just the right bitterness. Good balance. Very smooth. A good go-to pale ale.",
  "Oh phew!",
  "Much better than Cantillon. On second thought, as it warms up, I find it has a pencil kind of final...",
  "Very nice, low ABV, greenish. Great saison!",
  "Very frothy, tingling, with a mild roasted coffee taste. Nutty üçí üçí, yummy!",
  "Once you get over that intense bitterness, it‚Äôs a very satisfying stout, refreshing almost any temperature. You know what? I still think it‚Äôs good, if somewhat hoppy. Merci Matthieu L. & Vincent L.",
  "Ridiculously sweet and almost boring aftertaste, but this is better than the last time. Nice sourness and lime explosion. At 8.5%, it's barely bad. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I love that fruit, and in a good way. A great intro to the world of sour beers. üíïüíï Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Too much candy and booze in the mouth, too much nice and sour, a little hoppy, a little boozy. That's it. Nothing to write home about.",
  "Harsh, but that Malty touch by",
  "Spread the bourbon! So creamy! Creamy üòã",
  "As good as in January, much better than the previous version. Merci Matthieu L. et... Vincent L.",
  "Now you're talking! Tropical greatness. Well... old school...",
  "Honest stout, alright... not very complex, but still... quite hoppy. Lovely.",
  "Apple. Very nice.",
  "Very interesting, Different Port age as expected from DC. Medium tartness. Nice.",
  "Nice texture. Peach, but rather well rounded by caramel. Doesn't taste that bad, it's actually a pretty nice NEIPA.",
  "Dry, bitter, old school, but still coffee, chocolate, trace of salt, decent mouthfeel. Definitely has the Earl of summer üòõ",
  "Chocolate and coffee, a beautiful new brewery. What a treat! Delish! Merci Matthieu L. (Matatatow)",
  "A nice little saison of the same series. Almost an IPA. Good balance. Love the mouthfeel!",
  "On the sweet side. Very mild. Boozy. Pretty conventional.",
  "Tasty, with a peach aftertaste. Not my fave from Small Pony. Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "Yummy üòã 4.1",
  "Elderberry is unusual for a bourbon: it's not bitter, it just so happens to be sour.",
  "Oh! This is so good, just tart enough, dank, tropical, just sweet enough, goes well with a finger üíï I'll buy you guys more!",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad! 4.4",
  "Tropical, melon, good texture, nice DDH kick. Love those BBC releases! 4.12/5",
  "Slightly metallic nose. Old-school, but good balance. Pretty good for a pale ale. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Well balanced, delicate. Citrus and üçç. Very interesting... but a little thin. I like it.",
  "Beginners NEIPA. Not a big fan of the style, but this one is the best I've had ever.",
  "Always nice, sure bet. Dry, peachy finish. Such awesome sourness! Merci Vincent L.",
  "Canned 1 month ago, so it could be fresher. Still very nice, it's got that \"pioneer\" NEIPA taste. Nice texture. Love that brewery!",
  "Again, the herbal, the citrusy, the üçí. Creamy smooth. Would have preferred more creamy. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Typical DIPA, very fruity, quite hoppy. Upping it a notch, definitely has the Dominion or Belgian style of beer.",
  "Not very fizzy, rather complex, funk, apple, delicate. Quite enjoyable üíï",
  "Rather unique from Moutere.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Easily the best NEIPA I've ever had. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Probably the best gueuze I've had so far in my life. Thought it was better than Tiberius, but üíØ",
  "Surprisingly, my first NEIPA. Not her first NEIPA, either. In fact, her first official release as much for sure as for not. üíïüíïüíïüíï",
  "First time in a can. What's not to ‚ù§Ô∏è? The beans come out relatively well, but the Brett is a little thin for a light DIPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "As good as expected from DC. Thinnish, but good texture and watery hop burn. Merci Simon L. Simon L.",
  "Lambic??? What the  ?",
  "A little old school. Nothing stands out. Old school, but of little interest. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "On the sweet side. Quite nice, delicate lemongrass ever so slightly sour. Would prefer it less sweet though. 4.15",
  "Quite boozy, not as rich as I remember.  Delicious  üçí üçí üçí. A little thin. Will have more to it.",
  "Good coffee and Bourbon, just a hint of salt. Well balanced. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "No, 4.75! Rather bretty, hay. Medium sourness. Pleasant. 3.6",
  "Thinnish, but tasty. Slightly sweeter than I'd like. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Rather bitter, I like the tingling on the tongue. A little weak on the palate, but it's still very nice. 4.35",
  "Well balanced, delicate and quite dry. It is refreshing and a well-balanced but very wet day. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Tasty, maybe a tad too much Citra for me. Still very drinkable, but less than 4.",
  "Not bad, maybe not the best IPA around, but hey, respect! 3.6",
  "Gusher. A little thin, but very decent.",
  "Nice brown ale, not too malty, refreshing. Not the most complex brew, but it's still a pleasant and unique one.",
  "Disappointing, the vanilla doesn't quite gel, rather acetic and kind of watery. Nice finish.",
  "Good mouthfeel, slightly boozy, coffee is quite nice. 4.1/5 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Surprisingly thin for ABV (10.3%). Dark chocolate comes forward, hazelnut & bourbon are more discrete. Good, though I‚Äôd add more maple aftertaste.",
  "Quite boozy nose, not the most complex, but still a good quality summer beer. Merci Matthieu L. & Vincent L.",
  "Really nice texture. Peach, passion fruit, but above all: sugar. Makes you wonder if it's natural...",
  "Heineken DNA... very malty. A little boozy, but not overly boozy, either.",
  "Nice fruit, mild acidity as expected from Almanac.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I think this batch is a little flatter and maybe a little thinner than I remember. But it's still a good quality Small Pony. 3.85/5",
  "Now in the 3-month run time. Pretty sour, but not overly strong. Bourbon and a touch of green is interesting.",
  "In-your-face cinnamon. Bitter chocolate, less mouthfeel than expected, even for a November IPA. Really not bad! 4.3 Merci Simon L. & Vincent L.",
  "Amazing mouthfeel, from the West Coast, to Alaska. Not quite as tropical as some other iterations, yet flavorful and easy drinking. 4.35 üíï Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Amazing mouthfeel, from the West Coast to CA. Amazing hop bill from Ontario. Dank, glorious! üíïüíï Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice fruit, a little raw, a little something, nothing to it, I don't know how. Good texture. Good hop burn. 4.15",
  "Surprisingly simple. Dessert üç®",
  "About a year later, same rating. Great IPAs, great kettle sour, awesome mouthfeel. But I've had a couple of Nord-Est stouts lately that were not as good as what I was used to just over a year ago.",
  "Coffee and sour are like cats and dogs, not a good fit. Kinda dog fat, but tasty. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "The perfect winter night beer! Plum, chocolate, and bourbon blend so well! If you don't mind the Belgian taste, which is rather nice. Merci Vincent L.",
  "Nice coffee and vanilla character. Strong but well rounded. 4.15.",
  "üçí üçí üçí üç∑ üç∑. Not too tropical, not too dry. Very good!",
  "Very good texture, very nice bourbon nose, very refreshing. Almost 4.25.",
  "They call it a saison. Really?",
  "I feel I got hit by a train. Some old-school/West Coast DIPA! Respect!",
  "Straddles the boundary ‚òïÔ∏è",
  "Still good, good burn, not the most complex style, but still  one of their best.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Collab w BBC. Really nice texture and bourbon barrel, really well balanced. 4.4",
  "Wonderful raspberry! Amazing to drink in a glass. Quite slight carbonation, but quite good nonetheless. üíïüíï",
  "Obviously powerful IPA, but also a lot of watery aftertaste.",
  "Almost a month old but you wouldn't know it. Maybe my fave from Messorem so far. Good balance, just sweet enough, with a hint of chocolate, and well made.",
  "Not bad, good hop bill, maybe a tad gritty, old school. Good texture. Nelson Sauvin and Citra. 4.12.",
  "Very nice, good texture, nice bourbon barrel, not overly sour. The only mistake I have is taste in mouth, that sucks. 3.6",
  "Fruit brings a touch of mellowness to an already nice gueuze. It works, delicious but I expected more",
  "Fruit, tart, unexpected acidic kick, follows through on the sour side. A little tame, but that grape candy feels right. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Man, this is good. Easy drinking, thanks Tyson S.",
  "Really nice texture, nice little üëÖ to fall back to when hungry. Such a good texture! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Definitely not as powerful as I remember.",
  "I think this time, BTP. Not their best. Very malty, thin.",
  "Ridiculously good mouthfeel, chocolate and coffee balanced. Very good, if only a little tamer than regular Malty Head. Thanks Tyson S. Matthieu L.",
  "Simple chardonnay ale. Slightly caramel, very light. Well done.",
  "Oh yes! Best TIPA in my life! ‚ù§Ô∏è Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice heavy cream, coffee and vanilla, good texture.",
  "Amazing mouthfeel, from the Fruity side to the Dessert. Quite satisfying after coffee, vanilla and vanilla bean. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Really nice texture, nice  finish. Coffee and chocolate, really well balanced. Would love to buy this again. 3.9",
  "Typical British-style pale ale, rather malty. It works, although I was a little short in my fave. Cheap, but still a very good APA. Merci Matthieu L. et Vincent L.",
  "A little too sour for my liking. This ok, I'll be damned. Coffee and chocolate. Simple and good.",
  "It‚Äôs got the Bellwoods DNA, but maybe not as strong as expected. Delicate PA, dank, tropical fruit. 4.12/5 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Coffee and vanilla. Interesting combination that makes for a really nice coffee black ale.",
  "Tr√®s gros merci Vincent L. Antoine C. Matthieu L.",
  "Honest stout, beautiful door, and a trace of coconut aftertaste (gosh, it looks nice). It's got an Ontario twist, lime and lime and a touch of vanilla. Very good.",
  "Could be stronger, but still not a bad APA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Surprisingly thin for ABV (10.3%). Dark chocolate comes out rather well, but not overly sweet.",
  "Low acidity and bitterness, some bitterness, good hop burn, tropical. üëç",
  "Canned 1 month ago, so it could be fresher. Still very nice, it's got that \"pioneer\" NEIPA taste. Nicely done.",
  "Heineken DNA... not much aftertaste, but decent mouthfeel. Good little saison.",
  "Back on track, after a slip with their NEIPA. This one is one long, boring DIPA! Tr√®s gros merci Vincent L.",
  "Not much texture, faint cognac presence. All right. 3.64",
  "Beautiful dark yellow haze. Rather old school, piney, bitter and frothy (calls for a slow pour). Not very complex (it‚Äôs a single-hop ‚Äî Amarillo ‚Äî pale ale), but it‚Äôs enjoyable. 3.9/5 Merci Vincent L. et Matthieu L.",
  "In the can, maybe because it has a certain je ne sais quoi. Refreshing, fruity, quite nice, happy to share it!",
  "Holy moly! Excellent DIPA! Merci et moderation! üòã",
  "First time in a can. One of my fave Bellwoods IPAs. Dank, not overly sweet or tropical, some bitterness, good mouthfeel. 4.12. Merci Vincent L.",
  "Nice metallic and luscious nose. Follows through.",
  "Coffee and chocolate forward, thickened when cool. Refreshing.",
  "Not my thing. Overly sour for not'n. No mouthfeel, other than the sourness of the hops. Very crude. Merci S√©bastien B. & Vincent L.",
  "Dessert! Serious saison, not overly sour, fruity, not too thin, tastes great all around. Well done indeed!",
  "So sweet , lots of maple and rounded out by a dash of orange zest. Quite pleasant, would drink this every day. 4.15",
  "Nice hoppy saison, very delicate and subtle. Again, very nice, though...",
  "Oh yes! Tropical greatness!!! Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "Love the mouthfeel, the dry hop, the hop bite. One of their best NEIPAs, maybe their best so far. Yummy. 4.2",
  "With Pilsner... out of the Way!!!",
  "Now trying the IPAs,  little üçí.",
  "Still one of the best NEIPAs. Very fruity, very tropical. The base is good, but I could taste the can.",
  "Dry, bitter, old school, but still pretty boring. Pretty good.",
  "Honest stout, smooth AF with that üçØ üçØ üçØ BTP trademark. Easy drinking, thanks Tyson S.",
  "In your face at first. Nice.",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is very nice. Good coffee and good chocolate taste. Love that shop!",
  "Very delicate chardonnay ale. Rather bitter. Nice.",
  "Hazy, even though it's officially a NEIPA. Too much sugar, too much bitterness. Not what I'm used to. Going down. But still good!",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb, this is at least as good as the 1000 other people making this! Much better than I thought!",
  "Really not bad, but a little thin. Must contain Auval. Ok.",
  "Just very dank, juicy and refreshing. Delicious!",
  "Typical British-style pale ale, rather malty. For CA, it definitely is British-ish. üíï",
  "The most unusual of all the pils. No Moon Stone, instead Strawberry, Vanilla and lactose. Beautiful! üçí",
  "You can't go wrong with BBC IPAs. Always good! This one has to be fresh. 4.12-4.15",
  "Slightly peachy, pretty good mouthfeel.",
  "Thin but super tasty prune-and-pepper soup. And I have 2 more bottles üòú",
  "Amazing coffee, and definitely the wild ale version (grapefruity) of Gambrinus.",
  "Really nice texture, very nice.",
  "Mmmmhhhhhh!!! Draft this time... I like!!! Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "Dry, earthy, a little metallic. It‚Äôs got something to it.",
  "Dry, bitter, old school. No mouthfeel for a DIPA.  Definite üçç but thin.",
  "Dry mouthfeel, unidimensional, dank, peppery. Amazing for a dry, old school IPA.",
  "I think the pomace is becoming a little too obvious. Let's just have a coffee...",
  "Good texture, nice peach and mango presence, followed by vanilla  üçí (it‚Äôs malty). Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "Fruit, tart, wild, unexpected sourness. Interesting. Gros merci Marie-Christine et Renaud B. et Matthieu L.",
  "Oh! This is so good, meh!",
  "A little old school, but not much to it. Maybe could have been bolder.",
  "Dessert! Very good as expected from Dominion. Thick, sweet, tropical, particularly for a dessert stout. Amazing balance, love Auval!",
  "Oooohhh!!! üå∂ right away! Very creamy and quite thick. Very good value for $. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Really nice texture, very tropical. Some bitter coffee. Glad I checked. Straight out of class. üçí, coffee and vanilla, but oh so thin! 3.85",
  "Really not that bad. Old school, but not as bad as expected. Good mouthfeel.",
  "Oh, do them oats and blackberry does the trick! Creamy, strangely refreshing, like a grisette, slightly boozy, not too sour or dry, really well balanced... üòçBBC!",
  "Bold, bitter, old school. Nothing to do with the IPA. It was meant to be. Canned yesterday afternoon. 4.13. NEIPA is soapy, so watery, almost sickening, but it's still pretty, dank, tropical.",
  "Primal, pale ale, not too bitter, but not much mouthfeel. Good texture. No mouthfeel, though. Citrus. Not very dry. 4.12. Merci Simon L.",
  "Gusher, rather harsh. Sweet but thin and thin.",
  "Frothy AF when you pour, but man! Tongue tickler! üíï",
  "Still pretty good, low BA total.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I feel I got hit by a train. Some old-school/West Coast DIPA! Respect! Rating's bang on, gooooood! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Do I dig them Sticking to my guns as much as I'd like: these guys ain't getting 5% off!",
  "As delicious and complex as Solstice d'√©t√©!",
  "Simple kettle sour with a great mouthfeel. I have more yet! It‚Äôs a true NEIPA, eh? Not quite but still a powerful, well-balanced meal. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "It‚Äôs a NEIPA, not a Pils...",
  "Ah, Yummy, you've finally come out of the closet to assume your real identity: you're an experiment!",
  "Luscious fruit, delicate... complemented by a little bourbon. Very good.",
  "Very light red berries, apple and wine. Quite nice, but a little thin. 4.15",
  "Doesn't taste like 11% ABV. Tastes quite similar, but in a good way. Nice hops.",
  "Good coffee and chocolate nose. More coffee on the palate. Not very sweet. Mouthfeel OK for this low ABV. Honest coffee stout.",
  "Seems a little more local (not much to it) but I like it.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nose is all coffee. In the mouth, coffee right away, then trace of vanilla and cinnamon. Hoppy. Well-balanced. Mouthfeel OK for this low ABV. Not too shabby, I wouldn't change a thing.",
  "Batch #7. I've rated other batches between 4.5 and 5, but this one seems a little thin üòê. Almost an APA. 4.1/5 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Not much maple in the nose, but rather short and sweet. Like a tart with coconut dust. Nice.",
  "Doesn't taste like a recipe for coriander. Rather bitter. Almost bitter. Nice dessert.",
  "I prefer this one on tap. Delish.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot! Another great SPBW stout!   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Down .5, the coffee saves the day... errh... the night. What was I thinking, giving it 4.5? Maybe it‚Äôs because of the superior sour ale.",
  "The üçí is very nice and comes out more than the black currants. Almost creamy. But it's close...",
  "A trip back in time. Pretty nice old school IPA, hoppy and fruity. Like a kriek!",
  "That time of the year..... Not the best, but hey, it ain't Pepsi!",
  "Mmmmhhh! Another delicious Farma, this counts. Fresh can.",
  "Very good Bourbon, very nice bottle!",
  "Beautiful red currant, which follows through in the mouth. Delicious and complex. üçí, chocolate, coriander. So rich, deliciously fruity! 4.12",
  "Very nice, green, good citrus, but more bitter than melon. Ok.",
  "Canned 1 month ago, so it could be fresher. Still enjoyable, it's got that \"pioneer\" NEIPA taste. Nice mouthfeel. 4.35",
  "Vinous grape, all right, it's time to put it that way... 3.6",
  "A great APA, a little sour, surprisingly so. Would have preferred more ripe. Good nonetheless.",
  "Love the way they mix it with Nelson Sauvin and Citra. Very nice. Yummy!",
  "Bitter, raspy and gritty, tropical, not for the faint of heart, but mouthfeel is decent and dependable. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Not bad, but Somewhat watery. I was expecting more jam üòê. Still cool for a NEIPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Sticking to 4. Average mouthfeel, boozy. Not bad. 3.9",

  "1-mth+ can, brandy nose is ok, decently bourbon, vanilla and bourbon are present, but generically boozy.",
  "Very light and almost never hits the",
  "Batch #8, just as smooth as the one I had a year ago. Tastes like candy.",
  "Dry, bitter, old school, but still grapefruity with a hint of chocolate. OK coffee and chocolate.  Could be a tad more sweet, but I‚Äôm just not into this style.",
  "Not bad, maybe not the best IPA around, but hey, it‚Äôs a Bellwoods!",
  "As good as expected from Dominion. Tropical hop combo and old school as expected. Lo and behold, they nailed it!",
  "Really not bad, better than Needless Luxury.",
  "Arguably their best iteration. Tropical, well-rounded.",
  "Ah, Yummy, you've finally come out of the closet to assume your real identity: you're an IPA! l knew it all along, Baby! You're the queen! You're the queen! You're the best fucking IPA you've had... And I mean it like this:",
  "Rather nice, fruity, less sweet than most IPA du Nord-Est batches so far. Dominion falls in love with this masterpiece!",
  "Honest stout, very light, more like a session. Fruity about Matthieu L.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Easily the best creation from Collective Arts. Creamy mango, passionfruit, banana, tropical and stone fruit. And that's the fruit...",
  "Not bad, but Somewhat watery. I was expecting more jam. Maybe not that thin, but still enjoyable and interesting. 3.85.",
  "Hazelnut is a nut, and this is one of my first hoppy beers. A little thin, but still a very good APA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Excellent mouthfeel, as usual for Badlands. This one ain't bad.",

  "Coffee, prune, chocolate and üçí. Very nice. üíï",

  "Luscious coffee, lovely  üçí and vanilla, lovely mouthfeel. Really well done!",
  "Booze, cocoa and vanilla. Good mouthfeel. Not too shabby, I was expecting laughable. Straight out of BBC. 4.2",

  "Definitely not as nice as I remember.",
  "Tropical, melon, good texture, nice sourness. Probably my fave Fruity best NEIPA so far. 4.3/5 Merci Simon L.",
  "Very good texture, nice tingling on the tongue, another great option than this one, if only a little bit warmer.",
  "Not spicy at all, but thin... not bad! 4.25",
  "Simple but tasty, i.e. you guessed it, awesome!",
  "Never tasted before. Pleasant, refreshing, nothing to do with hops or ABV. Quite pleasant not much alcohol. Slightly raspy, ooohhh!!!",
  "Heaps of 7 different hops! Beautiful color, just the right hop burn and bitterness! Very good, don't go so far as to buy this in small packs...",
  "Oh, man! So rich! Tropical, lemongrass, peach and bourbon. Superb! Much better than I thought...",
  "Good balance of hops, bitterness, tropical. Pretty sweet.",
  "Slightly metallic, very nice. Pretty good.",

  "Sugar plum ü•• . Pony with grapefruit üëÖ. Very good, very raisin, very well made.",
  "Can you tell I had guests? At 5.5%, it's hardly satisfying. Thin, coffee is uninteresting...",
  "OK sour, rather bitter, maybe a little harsh, although with a juicy 4.4 % ABV. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice Cherry and Creamy Nelson Sauvin mouthfeel. Solid.",
  "Man! Boozy! Very dry. Not much coconut, which is nice, but it's more bitter than it should be. 3.65",

  "Sticking to 4. Average mouthfeel, boozy. Thin. 3.85",
  "üçí üçí üçí üç∑... in moderation, as it's more sour than your usual kriek!",
  "4.35. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Lime burst mellowed out by vanilla and lactose. Very pleasant.",
  "Hard to find better than this! It's easy to beat the Bellwoods nose, chocolate and bourbon, but it has a certain stone fruit... üíï",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy. Tastes like candy.",
  "Very good mouthfeel, as usual for Badlands. This one isn't the most fragrant and aromatic, though. Delicate peach and melon. 4.15",
  "Nice barrel, very light, just the right bitterness. Refreshing.",
  "Serious DIPA, quite light, grassy, not much fruit. Well balanced, nicely balanced! 4.4.",
  "The most boozy of the three batches, strangely acidic for ABV. Decent mouthfeel. Underrated, but still very good. 4.3",

  "Still one of the best NEIPAs around. Great mouthfeel, too.  Merci Matthieu L.",

  "Pretty sweet, quite malty, some bitterness. Nice mouthfeel. Decent.",
  "Lime burst mellowed out by vanilla and lactose. Very enjoyable and original. Refreshing.",

  "Really nice texture. Peach, mango, sour üçí. Very good üòä. Good texture. Really good.",

  "The most underrated beer in Ottawa.",
  "Not the most sour from Treehouse. Nice hop burn, but the fruit is just not where it should be. 4.10. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Not much personality.",
  "Simple amber ale, very nice but very new in the brewery. Ok.",
  "Medium boozy hop berry, medium tartness, dry-ish finish, a little fake. Pretty good.",
  "Medium tartness, nice.",
  "Easy 4.5, even if it was a small can.",
  "Very frothy, quite dry, but with a fruity, flowery side. Quite nice! 4.35",
  "Bretty, boozier than expected, some bitterness, rather dry, but above all, hop burn. Underwhelming!",
  "As if the recipe was not too bad, it isn't. Just a case of having too many pretty good ones in a small can. 3.85",
  "I think the boozy days are over. Boozy and stronger than ever. Now my last bottle sold! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Really not bad, good coffee and tasty brown ale.",
  "Very good IPA, hazy and a little raw. Very good in a can.",
  "Weak nose, rather bitter, rather ordinary. Quite sour, but could have more mouthfeel. Meh... errh... more like a session... üòõ",
  "Supposed to be close to finished time, but üíØ",
  "Nice fruit, a nice cherry, slight oak aftertaste, really well done.",
  "Very good indeed!",
  "Pliny, I've tasted better from Collective Arts... ooohhh, yah!",
  "Maybe the best batch so far. More or better Sabro? Almost 4.25",
  "Nose is all coffee. In the mouth, coffee right away, then taste the coffee in the mouth, which is much more gradual. Good texture. Refreshing. Intense. Not a bad coffee.",
  "Oh, this is one of the best gueuzes I've had!",
  "Their best one so far, best so-so batch. More or better Sabro. British.",
  "Meh... that's what happens when you host... people mean well, that's what counts...",
  "Holy moly this is ENGLISH! As good as in the West.",
  "Serious stuff! Foam, but not too strong, kind of old school, DC really? 3.85",
  "Light and fluffy, reminds me of Russian River's Trillium. Very refreshing, would drink this many yrs old...",
  "Pretty traditional, vinegar is quite thin. I like it. A little boozy too. 4.12.",
  "Thin pale ale, quite malty, a little hoppy, but that chocolate comes out too much. Bitter chocolate, disappointing taste. Whatever it is, it works.",
  "Beautiful red color, interesting funk, and some bite. Pretty good, would be refreshing, though.",
  "Fruit, tart, suitable for a collab with Nelson Sauvin... yet another weak Pils!",
  "Cutest name! fresher than most IPA du Nord-Est batches. Very decent coffee and chocolate notes, and an amazing 11% ABV. Merci S√©bastien B. Matthieu L.",
  "Always nice, sure bet, buck or not. Dry, oaky, very well balanced. This is one of my fave Messorem.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I think this time, it's a lager, not the most complex beer. At 5.4%, it's hardly satisfying. And yet, it's satisfying nonetheless. Amazing batch! Gros merci Marie-Christine et Matthieu L.",
  "Coffee and vanilla. Quite enjoyable. Almost 4.",
  "Easy peasy, excellent beer for a day or two. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Wood you mind? Oakay! Greenish!",
  "It's a porter, not a stout, and it‚Äôs mellower in finish than a grisette. Still very drinkable, but like a hybrid porter and stout. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Batch #4. Old faithful. OK for oysters. Almost 4.25.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Now in a can, I'm impressed with the Batch. Rich citrus and funk, more balsamic than regular JK. Dry finish. Not overly sweet, easy drinking, would be perfect for a terrasse.",
  "Still one of the best NEIPAs around.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very fruity, a little harsher than I'd like. Well, a little sour, but still a very good APA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Serious DIPA, very light and almost no hops. Very fruity. Approved.",
  "Beautiful dark yellow haze. Rather old school, piney, bitter and raw. Maybe a little harsh? Merci Matthieu L. et Vincent L.",
  "Better than I thought... I love it!",
  "More bitterness than sweetness, but nice grape aftertaste. BBC, you're üëë!!!",
  "Solid old-school IPA. Not their specialty.",
  "Scrumptious dark chocolate taste, like a different kind of candy. Must be the wild west, milkshake!",
  "Had the Sabro series before. Nice but d√©j√† vu from HHOE.",
  "Very delicious, More than a little sour, with a nice sour side.",
  "Oh yes! Superb sour, very fragrant, very delicate... amazing!",
  "A good old-school DIPA, ok coffee, coffee, but best is yet to be tasted. Underwhelming. 4.3 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Less crisp than expected. Up .25 aftertaste. Dryish finish. Nice.",
  "Once there, only a short hop still. Nice tropical bomb.",
  "Slightly tart, simple, but nice.",
  "Arguably their best one so far, one of the best HF IPAs in a long time. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Pleasantly surprised, better than I thought... Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Really nice texture, very nice. This is good. Vanilla. Not much to it. I like it better than P√©ch√© Mortel. 4.1!",
  "Last night. Great mouthfeel, nice coffee and light rum. Delish!",
  "Nice fruit, some grapefruit, a little boozy, not sure if it's green or not. Quite frothy. Was going to give 3.75. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Good texture, nice hop burn, not my fave from Dominion. Coffee, vanilla and coconut are very nice.   Merci Simon L.",
  "I agree with an Untappd friend: like a cross btw a juicy NEIPA and a saison. A little too bitter.",
  "Heineken DNA... quite unusual, but enjoyable.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Too sweet, not very tropical, ok coffee, but I don't use them very often. Ok.",
  "The oldest beer around. Dank, tropical, but with the typical Guinness finish, I wouldn't drink 2\" tall of it. Still very drinkable, I like it better than Sunsplit. 4.10",
  "A little funky, quite malty, a little hoppy. I don't get it.",
  "Peach is very discreet. But it sure beats blackberry. 4.12.",
  "Refreshing, very sour, but less fruity than expected, very nice! Fresh can, so... old can!",

  "Gusher, rather harsh. Pretty bitter, but still very good.",
  "Really nice texture, some balsamic vinegar and a little spice. This is good. Strong but good.",

  "Good texture, tropical, well rounded. A little thin, but great value for $",
  "Low acidity and delicious hop burn, tropical, uncomplicated in-your-face coconut.",
  "In my book, the best emperor after Tiberius. Yet it's complemented by 3F. So-so.",
  "Textbook Galaxy, mmmhh!!! Dank AF, tropical, ‚òïÔ∏è",
  "A little old school, but well made.",
  "Well, almost! Boozy, but more like a session. Merci Matthieu L.",

  "Not bad, but Somewhat bland.",
  "Nose is all coffee. In the mouth, coffee right away, then trace of vanilla and cinnamon. Nice üçí. Small can is about the right price. 4.15",
  "Very sweet, rather bitter, but not too sour. Not really sour to say the least. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Surprisingly thin for ABV (10.3%). Dark chocolate comes through,  little bit of vanilla, vanilla gets sweet. Still enjoyable, it works.",
  "sounds like a Polish IPA. Slight oak and vanilla, decent mouthfeel. Straight off the derrick. Respect!",
  "Fruit. Not sure if I prefer gueuze, üçá or not, but I'd call them that. Quite bitter.",
  "Oh shit, so good! I have to repeat to myself: so well done!",
  "The perfect winter night beer! Fruity, sour, tropical, refreshing! 4.4/5 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Good coffee, chocolate, vanilla, not too dry. Thick but not dry yet. My 1st one!",
  "Watered, I was pleasantly surprised for a non-BA imperial stout. Nutty, dryish. Low acidity. Well made, flavorful but not overly sweet.",
  "A little disappointing given the price and the expectation. Lacks roundness. Still good, low 4s. Barrel more than Bourbon. Reminds me of Founders KBS. 4.1",
  "Surprisingly thin for ABV (10.3%). Dark chocolate comes through immediately, and black currant is mellow. Good combination! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "It's a saison, not a much better one, maybe the best I've had from SPBW. Stone fruit, moderate carbonation. Very nice.",
  "It may or may not have had malt earlier in the year; the apples barely touch the hop bill. Old-schoolish, but still peach and grapefruit. I prefer my IPAs refreshing and frothy. 3.6",
  "Medium tart, still pleasant, winter beer, well balanced. Was going to give 3.75...",
  "Dry, bitter, old-school, but still very drinkable.",
  "Fruit juice with slight hop burn. Interesting, but I prefer the smoother one. I prefer BBC...",
  "Simple Northern DIPA. Nice hop bill and watery taste. Pretty typical Dominion IPA, though a little thin this time. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Consistent with other Hypas, rather bitter.",
  "Finally!! Easily the best gueuze you've had so far.",
  "Honest stout. Good coffee and taffy, vanilla being more forward than coffee. Lovely üòä",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Very good mouthfeel, super dry hop !",
  "Batch #8. What a dessert! Coffee, chocolate and bourbon blend so well! If only it had the KBS mouthfeel...",
  "Really not that bad. Nothing wrong, nothing better. On the plus side, üçí tastes very natural. Oakay!",
  "Simple but good, fruity, relatively well balanced. Decent.",
  "OK grisette, a little spicy and a little boozy, that's about it.",
  "This is very good, I dig the chocolate. Well balanced, if not the sweet.",
  "Old school. Good beans, but thinnish. Can't quite put my finger on it. Too sweet, hoppy, too old school.",
  "Pliny, I‚Äôd like it in a pie-perfect yah!",
  "Still very good, quality shit, but yesterday...  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Thick, dank, juicy. Citrusy and a little bitter for a NEIPA, but quite nice.",
  "Good mouthfeel, slightly tart and funky. Very well done! 4.4, I have another one to double-check.",
  "Yes, a few upping the heat a notch, a good mouthfeel, slightly tart, you know what you‚Äôre getting. An amazing DDC stout üôÉ",
  "Typical BTP nose. Quite mild, boring. BTP's pretty much the only consistent thing in my life. Downgrading.",
  "No need to elaborate, because it is... surprisingly tasty. The tamest gueuze, üçí and vanilla. Almost dessert. 4.35",
  "I love sweet stouts, but this really isn't bad.",
  "Not very sweet, not much funk, it's more of a hibiscus, fruity-flowery, citrusy, somewhat hoppy, a little tart, taffy, boozy. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Nice backyard ale. A little thin, but very bitter.",
  "Juicy, rather bitter, but good mouthfeel. Sweet, dank, easy peasy!",

  "Not bad, but Somewhat watery. I was expecting more jam. 3.88",
  "Good mouthfeel, slightly boozy, coffee is quite nice. 4.35. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Refreshing, nice bourbon kick, slightly sour, nice",
  "Citra and Simcoe, tropical, pretty good, wouldn't hesitate to order this over lots of others.",
  "Didn't realize I was buying 1-month old cans, maybe canning...",
  "Harsh, but it's true. Good old school DIPA.",
  "Not my thing. Overly sour for not'n. No personality. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Coffee, rich and thick, classic.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb... Yummy! Getting a little ridiculous...",
  "Nice mouthfeel, tropical. Not very complex, but good value for $. Mouthfeel OK, thinnish. 3.8",
  "A little thin, but tasty.",
  "Coffee and vanilla. Very good, but I may have had a lot earlier in the batch. OK, thinnish.",
  "Do NOT mix beers... in A&G!!!! üëÄ",
  "Subtle mosaic taste, wish it were more present, but nice nonetheless. No bottling date, so not sure how fresh it is.",
  "Typical British-style amber. Maple is quite low-key. It works... but only slightly...",
  "So sweet and spicy (as in pumpkin pie). Intense. Nutmeg aftertaste. Interesting, but I prefer my IPAs more hoppy. 3.65",
  "Dry. Dry. Old school. Simple. Honest coffee and vanilla pairing well. No mouthfeel for a DIPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Pleasant candy and a trace of vanilla. Interesting, but I prefer my IPAs more hoppy. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Crisp, slightly tart and funky, it's got that British twist. Full of cheddar üíï.",

  "Fresh can, maybe a tad sweet (egg?), but still a great APA. Better than most. Merci S√©bastien B. et Vincent L.",
  "Simple hops with a nice fruity touch. Like a weak Monogamy. Underrated. üíï",
  "Dry, earthy, a little astringent. Some thin. Would prefer it less harsh, but that's ok. Would prefer it better. 3.9.",
  "Basically a Hypa, very well made. Thanks Tyson S. Matthieu L.",
  "So rich. Winey, rich bourbon barrel, very nice, and very delicate. Could be a little more subtle. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Lime zing! Much better than the typical Malty PA. Very nice!",
  "Newfoundland is famous for itself, but this is one of its best. More than a little yummy. 3.7",
  "Not sexy, yet. Quite satisfying for a split Batch. Life's good, though.",
  "Definite Amarillo, not too sour, tropical, ok coffee, pretty good value for $, really ! Gros merci Mel!",
  "Revisiting almost 1.5yrs old. Lactose is very forward and unique, hazy, but bland.",
  "This is a fine stout, one of the best I've had. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Serious DIPA, very light, cocoa and vanilla. Not overly complex, easy peasy.",
  "Always nice, sure bet. Dry, oaky finish. The girls love it üòú",
  "Quite frothy! Winey, oaky, apple, tart. Really brings out the tartness! 4.35 Merci Vincent L.",
  "Sugar nose üòã This is so good, just sweet enough, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, very good üòä",
  "Very sour, very sour. Almost an amber. The hops do bring it back to earth, but it's a pale ale, so it's mild. Nice.",
  "Saturated like night. Amazing texture, love the üçí, but the whiskey. Like a wild, acetic, nightcap. Somewhat thin, but still very malty. Would prefer it less thin. This one just saves the day.",
  "Not too bad, thinnish, not much taste, but pretty damned enjoyable, if a little bretty.  Yeah, 4.25",
  "Some bitterness, dates, slight bitterness. Pretty good, but I'd struggle trying to sip it without sipping all at the same time. OK.",
  "Good mouthfeel, as usual for Badlands. This one ain't easy to find in DC.",
  "Rather crisp, not that much cereal. Maybe more lager than Pilsner? Nice  üçí.",
  "Not that familiar with IPA so this is not been my first beer... ü§î Good mouthfeel, usual \"gueuzey\" nose. üíï",
  "Too sour, rather bitter, but not too sour. Thinner than I'd like. Merci Renaud B. et Vincent L.",
  "God, this is so good üòä",

  "Vanilla and lactose forward. Sweet, but not too sour. Decent. Very nice.",
  "Very mild, delicate wine. Quite nice.",
  "Now you're talking! Fun and easy coffee fix, Ma! Dominion can definitely make their own version.",
  "It's a porter, not a stout, and it's still not bad, way down. Cheap, nothing to write home about.",
  "Heaps of 7 different hops! Excellent mouthfeel, tropical, but too much of that raw bite √† la Dominion. This is the best gueuze we've had so far in CA. 4.35 üíï Merci beaucoup Matthieu L. et Vincent L.",
  "Wow! Love it! So sweet! Creamy, tropical, üçí, green tea. Pretty sweet, thank God! Gros merci Matthieu L.",

  "Doesn't taste like 11% ABV. Maybe more like 8%. Decent mouthfeel, boozy, dank, hot. 4.4",
  "The little Sabro comes through, the berry Baby. So nice in my book (I mean it's just a baby bottle, not very tropical or tropical).   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Coffee kind of coffee, but very light and fluffy. Toffee, coconut, vanilla, great mouthfeel. Almost 4.",
  "Very good mouthfeel, peach, wine. Quite boozy in a wine state. A little boozy on the nose, and a little sweet on the mouth. Quite good.",
  "Not as saturated as on tap, but well made and delicious. 3.8",
  "Once tasted, & still, numerous times, better way to enhance your Sunday night ü§î East Coast!",
  "Wow! Excellent! Tropical fruit, üçç, chocolate. Very good!",
  "Now on tap. Delish!",
  "When you're following the l",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. The mouthfeel is there, though. 4.12. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Fruit. Not too sour, not too dry, not too sweet. Well, almost. As it warms up, warms...",
  "More House than Pepsi. Good mouthfeel, grapefruit, dank, slight hop burn, moderate hop burn. 4.12.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot! Delicate yet refreshing. Well made, delicious!",
  "Great mouthfeel, very hop-forward. Not too shabby! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "WOW! What a dry, oaky nose! Really smells like chocolate! Amazing for a pale ale! Pleasant, yet refreshing. Would be the perfect intro to the world of bitter chocolate.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Ah, Yummy, you've finally come out of the closet to assume your real identity: you're an onion!",
  "Simple pale ale, simple. More like a session...",
  "Weak nose, rather bitter, but I'm no expert. Pretty dry, the honey does get used to.  3.9",

  "Really good mouthfeel, lovely coffee, brandy, to name a few. Amazing for th ABV! Almost 4.5",

  "Seems a little more refined. Harsh, but nice grapefruit, and in a good way. Mouthfeel is ok. 4.15",
  "Vanilla and lactose, with a nice fruity side. Nice but a little thin. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice texture. Peach, maybe because of the lambics I had just before, but still lovely.",
  "Pleasantly surprised, better than most IPA du Nord-Est batches of late. Good mouthfeel, tropical, should‚Äôve gotten more than one can. Merci Matthieu L. , pas d√©√ßu!",
  "I prefer my stouts less sweet. Not that boozy, less sweet than expected. 4.15.",
  "Some pretty sickly pink. You know, things that people come away with well...",

  "Simple but tasty, i.e. you guessed it: chocolate. Oh! And Moka! üòú",
  "A little old school, but not as much as expected. Vanilla is rather discrete.",
  "‚òïÔ∏è, 3.95",
  "You can't go wrong with BBC IPAs. Always good! Discreet Bourbon, nice touch of sugar and really well balanced taste.",
  "Enticing nose, strangely enough, not very sweet. Rather funky and hoppy. Ok for a cold one...",
  "A little coarse, quite frothy, rather cold. Quite refreshing. Can't wait to taste their BA offerings (guava and chocolate) in your can.",
  "Less sour and tongue-tingling than other Dunham IPAs I've tasted, it's got a certain stone fruit to it. Nice.",
  "Very nice, good aroma, very fresh. Yummy!",
  "Now on tap. Juicy, hazy and hazy. A little complicated, not a lot of hops, l-thought it through.",
  "Beautiful red colour and delicious fruity nose. Rather old school (I‚Äôve tasted it before here). Original and nice.",
  "Fruit juice, lime sourness and bitterness, and some salt. Quite enjoyable. Pretty salty, I‚Äôd say. Yummy!",

  "Good mouthfeel, as is usually the case in Berliner. Tropical, hazy, dank.",
  "Could be thicker, but still tastes so very good! Portland on me!",

  "Nice texture and bourbon barrel, pretty enjoyable. 3.85",
  "Very nice , smooth, not too sour. Was going to give 3.75...",
  "Consistent with others from the same series, maybe a tad less sweet. A bit thin, yet delicious. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Light, fluffy, a tad tart, try it in a KBS or something. Delish!",
  "Nice mouthfeel, sweet with a bit of vanilla. Hard to tell apart from La Torre, which is both juicy and well rounded. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Usual pinky taste, didn't expect a lumpy classic IPA. Good, if rather short. 4.15",
  "Medium mouthfeel, dank and juicy, tropical. Not very bretty, which is a good thing. Would prefer it less sweet though. 4.12/5",
  "Probably the best batch so far. Lovely burn, chocolate and bourbon, just the right touch of salt and pepper, super dry. 4.35",
  "Man! Love this üçí! So smooth! Dank, not overly sour, tropical. Amazing mouthfeel for a single IPA. And this is the best one I've had from them.",
  "Maybe the best BBC stout so far. A great bet for a year or two old or so. Just sweet enough. Will hopefully age well. 3.85",
  "Just a regular old school IPA, but it's still pretty tasty, although with a certain thinness. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Luscious chocolate and caramel, perfect poolside companion. Merci Matthieu L.",

  "Had my first KBS so far. Nice hops, tropical and quite yummy. Will try later in crowler.",
  "Watered down apple juice. Pleasant. 3.85",
  "Surprising witbier. Almost lemony. Very good mouthfeel. A superior DIPA.",

  "What a dessert! Chocolate, coffee, bourbon, cacao, nicely balanced. Very nice. üíïüíïüíï",

  "Really good mouthfeel, funk, apple. Not too shabby from LTM. 4.15/5",
  "My fav Castor, crispy üçé and white wine, slightly sour, really well balanced. Would prefer it stronger, but that's not the taste. 3.6",

  "I think it‚Äôs my favourite LTM!",
  "This is like going back to when I discovered HF (Abner & Harlan) and Sip of Sunshine. Again, that \"pioneer\" feel, like a piece of history.",
  "Hoppy, citrusy and bitterish, but not overly, as if it were fruit. So-so tropical.",
  "Low profile lately, but DC hits a home run with this üë∂! Amazing mouthfeel, sweet and luscious, some serious DIPA!   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Odd coffee and vanilla taste, but not much mouthfeel. Good choice for a single IPA.",
  "Powerful coffee. Not too sweet, which is to be expected from a coffee stout. Not too bitter, which is to be expected from a PA. Medium berry.",

  "Very nice coffee, just what I need. A little too sour for my liking. Still great.",
  "Fruit and citrus... not very complex... but still delicious. Dry finish. Pretty good.",
  "Honest stout, lemon and mama appreciate that. Tastes similar, malty, but that's what makes it different. Nice hops. Merci S√©bastien B. Matthieu L.",
  "Almost an IPA. Good balance of fruit and citrus. Yummy! Merci Matthieu L.",

  "A little extreme, BTP better when you need it most",
  "Not shy of drinking something different from the American way. This one is about time! 3.9",

  "Not bad, but Somewhat less sweet than expected. Would be nice for a rather small can.",

  "It‚Äôs boozy, but that‚Äôs to be expected from a bourbon barrelled stout. Pretty good for the price. So-so texture. Now my head isn‚Äôt spinning, but still... still not bad.",
  "The most complex APA I've ever had.  Forgettable.",
  "Not much texture, rather gritty. Almost a light Brown. Ginger is very present. Surprisingly pleasant.",
  "In the can, can't miss it.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! I have to repeat to myself: this isn't a bomb! Two months old and still awesome! Creamy, tropical, well balanced. Would be more enthused in the summer. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Simple but classy, pretty good.",
  "Why break out just yet? The juice is nice but not overwhelming or bitterish. Well made.",
  "Dry, hazy, almost dessert. OK amount of sugar and sugar and sugar. Not too sweet. Reminds me of Nickel Brook's üçí DIPA. Not too shabby!",
  "Not bad, good coffee taste, but thinnish. It works.",
  "Not very complex, but well done. I like!",
  "Almost a PM, but it has a reason to be; in a good way. Good mouthfeel, too. 4.15",
  "Finally, a good IPA to compare it to. Rich, comfort food, yummy... and yah! 3.9.",
  "Thin, spicy, dank, pretty good. Sip it slowly! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Heineken DNA, maple, dates, really? Mixtape Badlands, I say repeat!",
  "Mmmmhhhhhh!!! Draft this time... I like!!! It‚Äôs got SPBW here, and it definitely shows on the nose. Blurs the mind üòú",
  "Refreshing, pretty much the best IPA you can get at the local LCBO.  Vince L.",
  "Very interesting type of sour, bitter, earthy, quite tart. Refreshing.",
  "Batch #9. I've rated other batches between 4.5 and 5, but this one seems a little thin üòê. Almost an APA.",
  "Smokey crazy mouthfeel. Pretty good, 'n crispy. Not overly sweet, quite boozy. 4.15.",
  "Quite boozy nose, not so much on the palate. Good BA stout, but not the best-tasting one, either.",
  "Frrooty-frrooty! Excellent DIPA, very fragrant (Vic Secret), excellent DIPA from the masters! 4.4, up by half a point!",
  "Now in the can. Gotta get my fix of those cold ones. Typical Dominion nose, sweeter than I thought. Good texture, bitter or not, pretty damned good. 3.6",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy. Slight oak bite. Pretty good.",
  "What a treat! This is the best pale ale I've had so far in a Nabob! Wine, vanilla and lactose! Amazing mouthfeel, flowery, amazing!",
  "I don't know much about the style or hops used, but I quite like it. Good balance, if not the most complex IPA out there. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Hop on by the side of Deceptively Good Polish. Nice barrelly taste, not too sour. Definitely has the Deceptively Good Polish reference, which I have not tried before. Nice.",
  "Batch #7. I've rated other batches between 4.5 and 5, but this one seems a little thin üòê. Can't seem to get over my head. ‚ÄúMidwest‚Äù thing is holding up quite nicely üòê",
  "Grossly underrated, yet amazing. Canned June 2018. Almost 4 months old. Still amazing!",
  "Dry, bitter, piney, somewhat metallic. And what a drop üò©",
  "Good coffee, raisin, molasses, not too bretty. Low acidity. Well balanced. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Easily the best creation from Collective Arts. Creamy blueberry, hazy, tropical. Amazingly smooth. Getting to love this man!",
  "Good mouthfeel, very funky. No disappointment here from HF.",
  "Batch #9, just awesome. I have yet to taste anything better. üíï",
  "Easy 4.5, super dry. Amazing hop burn (tropical). Amazing finish. A little... outstanding. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Dense, intense, saturated, beautiful mouthfeel. Almost 2-mths old, would probably rate it higher if fresher. Thank you mucho Tyson S. 2015. üçç Merci Matthieu L.",
  "All right.   It's time to put... all... up!",
  "Really nice texture, nice julep, not too sour, dry finish. Great!",
  "Free from the brewer. OK IPA, not much BA, but hey, it‚Äôs a Bellwoods.  3.9",
  "This is rather nondescript. Very low quality hops, and low sugar content. Interesting, though.",
  "Pretty sour, quite malty, interesting try. Decent.",
  "Seems to have more bite than #GiT: sweet hops, bitter, not too sweet, a tad too vinous. All right, I guess... 4.35",
  "Nice vanilla, but not sure how natural it is.",
  "Wonderful fruit, although blueberry's discreet as always. Very well done.",
  "Rich coffee, some bitterness, good mouthfeel, super dry. I don't know enough about the aged beer. Will have to revisit. Decent...",
  "Serious stuff! Foam, cheese and vanilla. Rather thick, not that thick on the palate, but still very pleasant.",
  "Canned 3 days ago. Definitely a go-to stout, packs a real punch. To revisit!",
  "European twist.",
  "I think this is the best Bellwoods IPA I've had so far. A great little fix of sunshine and ‚òïÔ∏è .  Merci Vincent L.",
  "Fresh can, a little dry, one of the good batch.",
  "Hazy, hoppy West Coast, but a little too bitter. Can't say it's my fave. Bitter, bitter and hoppy.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Gusher. Nice coffee and very decent texture. Delicious. Simple, refreshing, year one!",
  "Nice coffee and vanilla character. Easy drinking, thanks Tyson S.",
  "Good mouthfeel, juicy, typical House style, but typical Lupulus juice: oak, carbonation, bite. 3.6. Merci Renaud B.",
  "sounds like a blanc. Need to revisit. 4.12",
  "What a mouthfeel! Very sweet, happy to share it!",
  "Almost a month old, but it's still very nice (a little much), taste is quite decent, could be a tad more used. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Good texture, nice peach and mango, a little bitter, not as anticipated given the price ($3). Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Dessert! Very nice, lots of üçí, but a little thin. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice roundness. Mouthfeel of a lambic,  ooohhh, ‚ù§Ô∏è",
  "Never tasted before. Pleasant, dry, oaky. Very nice.",
  "Doesn't taste like 11% ABV. Maybe more like 9%. Decent.",
  "Not bad, maybe not the best Baltic porter out there, but it's still a good beer.  4.35 Merci  Matthieu L.",
  "Slightly peachy, pretty nice. Easy drinking and can't wait to taste their BA offerings (gotta be patient).",
  "Really nice texture, a little old-school, very well made.",
  "I rarely drink pilsners, but I'd say this is a good one. Crisp, dry, cereal, interesting twist on the beer.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Easily the best NEIPA I've had. Ok.",
  "Very frothy nose, but shy of expectations. Really not bad, considering the price. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Mmmmhhhh! This is like going back to when I discovered HF (Abner & Harlan) and Sip of Sunshine. Again, that \"pioneer\" feel, like a piece of history.",
  "So easy. Merci Vincent L.",
  "Very nice, good oak presence, but not very hoppy. 4.12.",
  "Surprisingly smooth, I wasn't expecting this. Smooth, not too sour, I like it.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Dry, earthy, a little astringent. Rather harsh. But still a great option for afternoon coffee and chocolate bar. 4.35",
  "Easy 4.75, Lightly drinkable. Better than expected. Merci Vincent L.",
  "Similar to P√©ch√© mortel. No mouthfeel, very light, very tame. No tone btw...",
  "Amazing mouthfeel, from the West coast to CA. And I have a couple more weeks to myself...üòú",
  "Powerful. Very sour. Gets better as it warms up. Really not bad.",
  "Amazing üçí nose, quite complex. Fruity, but I think it's just been underwhelming. Candy, vanilla and coconut. Thinnish, yet enjoyable. 3.7",
  "Tropical, melon, good texture, nice DDH kick. Strong but that DDH isn't needed. 3.9",
  "Ever so slightly old school, but still enjoyable. Beautiful color, very nice wooden take on an old-school beer.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic any better! These guys are masters! I have yet to taste anything better. So goood on a hot summer day!",
  "Now you're talking! Great mouthfeel, smooth with little to no sting, and the zing! üíï",
  "Very sour, very disappointing single hop. Thinnish, yet enjoyable. Not the most complex NEIPA out there, but it's still a good mouthfeel. Merci Simon L. and Merci Simon L.",
  "Too sour and dry for me, harsh on the lambic base, a little sweet. Ok.",
  "Not that familiar with those guys, but this is like a sweet, hoppy good coffee, smooth. Very nice. 4.4",
  "Old school and overly bitter (i.e. a blonde is a good hint). Decent hop bill. One of my first Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very good saison with a nice fruity side. Nice.",
  "Malty, sour and lumpy, chocolate and coffee, but tongue-tingling. Doesn't quite cut it with HHOE.",
  "Bottle this time. Sorry, no pickcha. A real old-school DIPA,  smooth, with notes of chocolate.",
  "Nice fruit, probably more robust than Moutere. Nice texture, maybe a little sweet, but still dank and juicy. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Honest little stout, alright. A little thin, but ok for sweeter (Bourbon?). 4.3 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very nice, decent mouthfeel. Really not bad,  HF  Mosaic. Well-balanced, no  oak. Mouthfeel OK. 3.9",
  "The smoke is surprisingly moderate. It does add character to a good meal, if a tad thin. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I think the whiskey taste is my real dislike. Really???",
  "Luscious mouthfeel, tropical, funky, taffy. Great beer for an unusual time in your life. üíïüíï Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Honest stout, not too sour. Quite nice, I wish I had had more!",
  "Ah, Yummy, you've finally come out of the closet to assume your real identity: you're an amber ale! l knew it all along, methinks. Lovely üçí, nice funk and wood. I don't know enough about hops. Low to medium hop burn. All right. 3.64",
  "Going up .25. The vanilla has a bit of a metallic taste, but the sugar isn't overwhelming. Good texture.",
  "Refreshing, nice sour side, but not very complex. Like a weak Monogamy. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Fruit, sour, lovely.",
  "A little disappointing because of the date, vanilla and lactose are nice. Mixed with juice? Bring it on...",
  "Second try, I confirm it's a pale ale version of Baron. Candy and caramel, not overly boozy or anything. Very nice.",
  "Ma! Oh! What a treat! This Moutere! Not a party hop, very fruity, not overly sweet. üíïüíïüíï. This is serious goodness. Merci beaucoup Matthieu L. Antoine C. Matthieu L.",
  "Very fruity, i.e. flowery. Refreshing.",
  "A little thin, but well made and tasty. Yummy!",
  "Doesn't taste like 11% ABV. Maybe more lager than a saison. Merci S√©bastien B. & Vincent L.",
  "Peach is very subtle, delicate, not that forward.",
  "Shall I call it Old Faithful? The first real Hypa, and one of the best. Nelson Sauvin and Citra ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è Merci Simon L. , Rest In Peace.",
  "Always nice, sure bet, good hop bill.  Traditional West Coast take, sure bet, probably Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Lime explosion! Huge mouthfeel, awesome berry with a touch of vanilla and some sugar. Very nice! üíïüíïüíï",
  "Big coffee nose. Better texture than expected. Nice coffee taste, but oh so thin! Whatever it is, it‚Äôs still a great DIPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Sticking to 4. Average mouthfeel. 3.85, outside is pretty nice. Wintery.",
  "Forgot the part. Sorry, no pickcha...",
  "So sour . A little astringent, though. Yet to find a better one.",
  "Good mouthfeel, slightly boozy, coffee is quite nice. 4.4/5 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot! üíïüíï",
  "Very nice and crispy on the outside, but inside, it's a little on the dry side. In the box, good looking oatmeal stout, port and raisin, trace of vanilla, good mouthfeel. 4. so far!",
  "Simple old-school IPA, fairly flat, good for a first. Old school as in, not as hot as it used to be.",
  "Funky is a good word. Dank, dank, dank. One of the best Hypas. 4.2/5",
  "Oh yes! I think this is one of their best releases so far. Very jammy, great texture. Peachy. Amazing!",
  "A little crude, but good taste comes through. Peachy.",
  "Seems a little more drinkable  in the mouth. Nice bitter finish. Less 1.5",
  "Obviously powerful, more like a Medium than a DIPA. Good balance...",
  "Good mouthfeel, slightly boozy, coffee is quite nice. 4.2",
  "A little thin, but nice bourbon base adds a nice fruity kick. Well made.",
  "Bottle this time. Apparently, it's from Alaska, after all. Nice DIPA.",
  "Man, this is good. In my IPA top 10! Up .25 yet again. üçç Better than Cassis Bleuet.",
  "Meh... decent saisons. Not that tropical or anything. Lacks bitterness because of the BBA. Still nice, solid.",
  "Quite boozy nose, not so much on the palate. Good bitterness, but I can tell it's getting a little tired out. Coffee and chocolate balanced it well. 4.15",
  "Not too bad, thinnish, not much taste, but not much aftertaste either.",
  "Pleasant marshmallow, caramel and vanilla, decent mouthfeel, not Bas-Canada level, but still an ok dessert.",
  "You should have more texture than you're getting from Almond. Thinnish for 11%. Sweet vanilla and chocolate. Slightly woody. 4.15",
  "How can you go wrong with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy? The usual BBC class, melon, tropical fruit and an amazing mouthfeel. A great DIPA üíï",
  "Hazy, hoppy Red wine, very tropical.",
  "Grape, lemongrass, boozy, rather boozy, more tropical than IPA du Nord-est. Quite classy.   Merci Matthieu L. Matthieu L. 4.1",
  "Fruit, tart, strange. Bretty, woody, interesting. I don't know this style, but I like. 4.12.",

  "I think this is my favourite P√©ch√© Mortel version.   Merci Renaud B.",
  "Vanilla and lactose forward. Nice dessert, not too sour, too. Easy drinking. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice mineral, delicate, greenish. Very good for the style.",
  "Nice mouthfeel, lime and lime pie flavors, decent mouthfeel. IIRC, my fave from Collective Arts. Such classy people!",
  "Very good. Even better than I thought. Splendid juice.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Now in the can. Umpteenth time in a can, probably give it another try. Great mouthfeel, rich funky bourbon, classic Goose Island. Almost 4.",
  "Nose is all espresso. In the mouth, coffee right away, then trace of vanilla and cinnamon. Hazy nose. Pleasant coffee! 4.15",
  "Now you're talking! Delicious cereal stout, and you're close. Another great stout from OH! Dominion City, this is how good you could be! Close to 4.",
  "Batch #7. In the same range as last time, Great texture, Great hop bill (Thinnish). Not bad.",

  "Simple old-school IPA.",

  "Ah, why not, good old Sunsplit. Best entry-level NEIPA in the small can.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb!!! Frothy AF! So rich and boozy! Boozy too! üíï",
  "Good texture, nice barrel, nice hop burn, not too sweet. Could have a little more mouthfeel. Merci Renaud B.",
  "I think this is the best NEIPA so far. A bit thin and one-dimensional but still very good. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Well-done by Small Pony. I don't know enough about the style, but I'd rate it higher than their Spring IPA. Such classy hops! 4.35",
  "Quite boozy nose, not so much on the palate. Good BA stout, but nothing stands out. Way overpriced. 3.6",
  "Really great mouthfeel, like a DIPA. Definite coconut, too. Dry finish. Almost 4.",
  "In your face at first. Nice Bellwoods PA. But gets boozy, maybe a little harsh. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Not really something I look for in a ‚Äî thin ‚Äî stout. Rather crisp, almost coffee based. Pleasant coconut aftertaste.",
  "Not overly sweet, very tropical, very boozy. Very nice!",
  "Honest stout, malty, slightly fruity, quite enjoyable, could be somewhat hoppy, but I find it's too sweet and insipid. I'd prefer it less sweet.",
  "Simple summer treat. Slightly hoppy, more like a session... Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very refreshing, nothing is exaggerated, discrete grapefruit, trace of salt, very tropical.",
  "Not much texture, rather creamy. Pretty good considering the price. Merci Matthieu L.",

  "Canned Dec. 2018. Still pretty fucking good,  four packs at least. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very mild, nothing special. Just a decent saison.",
  "Low-key blonde, this is very fruity (citrus, banana, coconut). I taste cherry, but definitely more sour. Never tasted this before. Karmic!",
  "Not bad, alright.",

  "Better than in March, rather dry. Slight oak & coffee, not overly boozy. Good balance.",
  "It‚Äôs a greyish IPA, watery, rather bitter, not very complex, not much citrus, pretty much any other typical West Coast IPA. 14.5% üíï",
  "A little old school, but that triple espresso shot Is impressive. Reminds me of Jutsu.",
  "More sour than other Double Irish IPAs I've tried, thicker and even more bitter than most. Merci Matthieu L. (Matatatow)",

  "Wood that seems to dry out somewhat. Not bad, but a little thin. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "You can't go wrong with BBC IPAs. Always good! Thanks Tyson S.",
  "Seems a little more tame L'enfer, not much to it. Well, not much, because it's an amber ale.",
  "Simple can, nothing more. Small can is nice, but I like the small can.",
  "Do I dig those guys. Boozier than expected, boring. Yawn. Merci Matthieu L. and Tyson S.",
  "Caramel and blueberry, taste is hazy, OK, errr.... not great. 3.85, almost 4",

  "Wood you mind? Oakay! Tropical bomb! Mouthfeel and hop bill as well. Awesome!",
  "2nd tick for this baby because it's such a great cure for the shitty, depressing November weather. Tropical greatness. Wouldn't it also be super awesome for when the time was right?",

  "Fruit, tart, unexpected touch of tartness. Very good. One of their good ones. 4.2/5. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Plum and apricot come out rather well, but acidic spices add a somewhat dry and currant aftertaste. Thinnish, yet enjoyable. 3.65",

  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot! Such texture! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Excellent mouthfeel, as usual for Badlands. This one isn't the most fragrant and aromatic, though. Delicate peach and melon. 4.15.",

  "Bitter, oaky, sweet, fairly boozy. This is very much an IPA. Day one. Reminds me of Karma, only better. üíï",

  "Delicious chocolate, hazelnut and vanilla, decent mouthfeel, not Bas-Canada level, but still an IPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Surprisingly smooth, I could swear to my name, but I think it should be called KBS, as it has a bit too much lime and bitterness. Must be a BBA stout, not an APA one.",
  "Hazy and quite sweet, happy about a nectarine palate. Very nice! 4.2",

  "Oh! This is so peach and juicy it almost tastes like peach juice (a good one, I believe). And because I have three of these, I get triple ‚ò†Ô∏è",

  "A little old school, but that hint of lime, and the tartness of thyme. To love it.",
  "I think this is my favourite Merci S√©bastien B. or just plain Evil Twin. So nice after so much shit... Even better than Untappd!",
  "What a drop üòú",
  "Not bad, maybe not a little sexy, but still a great NEIPA. Merci mon ami Antoine L.",
  "Coffee and vanilla. Very nice.",
  "How can you go wrong with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy? The usual BBC class, melon, tropical fruit and an amazing mouthfeel. Fresh can.",
  "Good balance of acidity, malt and bitterness. Quite sweet for an amber ale. Merci Matthieu L.",

  "Not great, but pretty good, quality coffee, nice balance. Do I drink more? Probably. Almost. Close to 30.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Grape, but too much of a good thing, too much of a good thing. Too much sugar, too much ABV, not sweet enough either. Can't be the whole 1/4\"...",
  "You wouldn't know it's a collab w BBC. Typical Dominion harshness and oniony bite. Boozy. Nothing to do w BBC mastery and mellowness. 3.6",
  "Smells pretty darn good, fruity  and some salt. No coffee, just sour cherries. Rating is bang on, 4.4.",
  "Very sour. Quite nice, but a little thin. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Seems a little more Coke-ish, but that's about it.",
  "How can you go wrong with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy? The usual BBC class, melon, tropical fruit and an amazing mouthfeel. Such quality!",
  "Gusher, resinous, tropical, quite nice. Tickles the tongue and throat. No disappointment here...",
  "So nice after so much better ABV...  Lacks a bit of its zing, but that's mostly about the beauty of IPAs. 3.6",
  "Subtle mosaic taste, satisfying its teeth. Ginger is very present, but other than that, it tastes like root beer. I prefer it weak and malty. Ok.",
  "Oh, Yummy!",
  "Not that familiar with the style, but this seems to be losing bit over bit. Softer, more subdued. Thanks Tyson S.",
  "Batch #6. I've rated previous ones before, but this is the first one I've tried. Very nice. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Amazing üçí nose, tropical. Not as hoppy as I was led to believe. Good balance. Pretty good, thanks Tyson S. Matthieu L.",
  "Just like so many other breweries. Excellent, if rather small, for the style. Even better than Needless Luxury.",
  "Fruit! Really fruity, some funk, and at 5.5%, it‚Äôs real rubber meets metal. Amazing party dessert!",
  "Nice berry, not too sour. A nice change. Very well done.",
  "The coffee is very pleasant, and the coffee seems to age well. A little thin.",
  "Doing a little 2nd run this year. Old school and not very complex.   BBC really isn't their  #1 choice, but I wouldn't rule it out.  3.9",
  "Nose is all coffee. In the mouth, coffee right away, then trace of vanilla and cinnamon. Scrumptious coffee.",
  "Very nice dulce + delicious sausage. Quite tasty!",
  "Thin, sweet, slightly piney, quite dank, slightly sweet.",
  "Serious dust. Mouthfeel OK for this low ABV. Honest coffee stout, not too complex, too sour, oaky, acetic. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Easily the best creation from Collective Arts. Delicious spicy goat cheese! Merci Simon L.",
  "Very good, still so good, lots of maple, one of the best kinds of insipid brews you can imagine. 4.35",
  "Heaps of 7 different hops! Excellent mouthfeel, tropical, should be getting a follow-up. Merci Matthieu L. & Vincent L.",
  "At 5% ABV, ceci n'est pas une IPA, it‚Äôs at a",
  "Les thick than expected. Rather boozy, raisin, molasses, not too sweet. 4.15",
  "Ridiculously sweet, more than a little boozy. Medium tartness. Oh! What a cure for a shitty medicine! üíï",
  "Serious stuff!!!",
  "It's got the Bellwoods nose üòä. We're close, boozy. Nice hop and bite. Refreshing. Oh! And sweet! üíï",
  "Very sour, very piney. Quite nice, but too sweet. Honest, delicious üòã 4.35 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "The best New Brunswick stout I've had. Oak is discrete.",
  "OK, nothing special. Just a decent dry lager.",
  "Harsh, but you know what you get. üíï",
  "Nice dry hop. Fruity. Not a big fan of IPAs, but this one is the best I've had ever.",
  "Seems a little more rounded after a couple of weeks, maybe not as sweet as I remember.",
  "More acidic than I like, but still very good.",
  "Huge jam nose. At 11% ABV, it‚Äôs pretty intense, and then you have the dry hop, which is somewhat understated. Very enticing! 4.15/5",
  "Never tasted before. Pleasant, refreshing, you guessed it, funky. Well, I guess BTP is like drinking a dark lager, only a tad more boozy.",
  "Wow! Love it. Great dessert! Better than expected. Amazing mouthfeel, yummy! Merci S√©bastien B. et Renaud B. et Matthieu L.",
  "Nice fruit, a little boozy, a little piney, a start but not too far. Well made.",
  "OK British IPA, not that typical of BBC. Nice texture, kind of IPA aftertaste.",
  "A little old school. Nothing particularly stands out. Was expecting more from Bor√©ale. Happy to just have a good beer.",
  "There comes a time when a man's gotta make decisions. The time's now: open that damned bottle now. 4.1% üçí",
  "In the can, but you wouldn't know it. Malty. Very delicate...",
  "Very nice, good mouthfeel, slightly sour, my fave from Collective Arts. A great local, although I would change a thing or two in my rating of this one.",
  "Really nice texture, very well made. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very sour, very piney. Quite pleasant if you're into that style upping it a notch.",
  "A little old school. Nothing particularly stands out. Old school, but the whiskey and the wood are very present. OK.",
  "Simple porter, chocolate and vanilla. Very nice. 4.15",
  "Not too bad, thinnish, easy drinking. Almost 4.",
  "As good as expected from Dominion. Tropical, hazy, dank. Better than I thought (or thought not) üòê",
  "Wow! I agree with an Untappd friend: like a cross btw a juicy NEIPA and a saison. Quite yummy. Will I ever try it? Probably not for LCBO...",
  "Very boozy nose. Old school, but not a whole lot older than this. Great mouthfeel, tropical. Amazing at a relatively cheap price!",
  "Really well balanced. Peach, chocolate, coffee. Sip it slowly! This is dank, juicy, satisfying after a bike ride in 30+ degree heat. Some good NEIPA.",
  "Some bitterness, but good mouthfeel. Not much bitterness, which is interesting given the ABV. Merci Vincent L.",
  "Spread the ü•• over time. Really good AND thicker than expected, but still bland.",
  "Complex, funky, slightly boozy, everything in moderation. Really well done! 4.4, I'm impressed with the quality! Grand Marnier!",
  "How can you go wrong with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy? The usual BBC class, melon, tropical fruit and an amazing mouthfeel. A great DIPA üíïüíï",
  "I think they exaggerated the cocoa. It's still nice, thick and a little sweet. Merci Matthieu L. et... Renaud?",
  "Easy 4.1, Light aftertaste.",
  "Fruit... not my first beer. Not the most complex, but overall quite nice. 3.9",
  "Beautiful red color, delicious red wine, quite malty, üçí. Not an IPA, but very good one, if only a little raw. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Fruit! Really good, although this batch may be a tad harsh, just being consistent. Yummy! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I think they forgot to put the Tropical fruit on the base of the peach. üëå",
  "Refreshing, nice sourness, not too sour, maybe a tad fruity. Sticking to my guns, best West Coast IPA I've had.",
  "Old school, stupid dose. Nothing particularly shines. 3.85",
  "Doing quality control on my survival stash. Overly sour for not'n. At 5.5%, it's hardly satisfying. Merci Renaud B.",
  "The most English berry I‚Äôve tasted. Very fruity, vinous and yellow üçí, very well balanced. 4.4/5 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Almost a month old but you wouldn't know it. Just the right bitterness. House-quality hops, fruity. Very good mouthfeel.",
  "Not my thing. Overly sour for not'n. No personality. Merci Patrick C.",
  "About a year after I first bought TW, excellent but otherwise the same. Well balanced, pleasant and simple. Going up .25",
  "Grossly underrated, far less rare than expected. One of the best NEIPAs around!",
  "Very light, definitely a beach beer. The hops tickle the tongue. Easy drinking, thanks Tyson S.",
  "Oh, do them oats and blackberry ever hit the spot! üíï",
  "Surprisingly smooth for a NEIPA. Might be my 1st old-school IPA and the only one I've had before. Lacking a bit in personality.",
  "Tropical, melon, good texture, nice DDH kick. Somewhat thin, but still a great DIPA. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Juicy, hoppy, saturated, kind of like a tart IPA. Better than expected. 4.3 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I have a soft spot for Nelson Sauvin. This batch seems a little flatter and thinner than most. Yummy! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad! 4.35",
  "Very sour üçí, almond üçí, vanilla, chocolate. Not very hoppy, but not the most depressing sight to see. 3.65. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice mouthfeel, chocolate. Excellent!",
  "This would make for a nice summer beer, but definitely not as good as the previous batch. Will have to revisit. 4.15",
  "This is very good, i.e. green.",
  "A k√∂lsch? Very nice, subtle coffee aftertaste, but not much aftertaste.",
  "Never tasted before. Pleasant, sweet and old school. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Surprisingly smooth, I think it‚Äôs the best batch so far. Good fruit, VT my first ever NEIPA. ‚ÄúMidwest‚Äù IPA. 4.35",
  "Simple dry ale, simple but refreshing. Lovely üçí and vanilla. Mouthfeel ok, it doesn't quite cut it with ABV (6.5%) but... it doesn't taste like üçá. This is complex. I'm done complaining. 4.35",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy, with vanilla if you want, followed by coconut touch-up. OK mouthfeel. 4.35, almost perfect! 4.6",
  "Happy to try it on tap instead of having to buy another one. Yummy!",
  "I think this is my favourite P√©ch√© Mortel version. The coffee and vanilla are very present, but not too strong. Good balance.",
  "Beautiful dark yellow or greyish color. Pretty bland.",
  "Nice fruit, moderate pepper sting, tasty!",
  "Meh... that's moderation!",
  "Mmmhhh... pretty good!",
  "Grape, lime and lemongrass all come out rather well. IPA still a little crude, but that coconut touch gives it bite. Merci Vincent L.",
  "Have to put it down. Nice NEIPA, not the most extravagant or complex, but still very nice. 3.7",
  "Coffee, plain and simple. Not too bitter.",
  "Amazing fruit, super creamy. No need to put much longer consistency lines on this lightweight stout. 4.13 üíï Merci Matthieu L.",
  "So sweet, so chocolate, vanilla and gueuze aren‚Äôt a word. Creamy, very pleasant, not too sour, not even close. Gros merci S√©bastien B.",
  "Oh yes! Frothy AF! So creamy, so delicious, so good, way better than the regular one!",
  "Wow! Tropical storm! Tremendous mouthfeel, thick dank goodness, delicious! Merci Renaud B.",
  "Weak nose, rather bitter and malty. Rather harsh. Good mouthfeel. Very nice, if only a tad cheap. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "TGIF***ing great beer nightcap over coffee. Melon and üçç, too, + chocolate. Rather nice.",
  "Les thick than expected. Boozier than I had hoped. Very sour, a little woody. All right, I guess... 14.5%...",
  "Good balance of sugar, pepper and bitter grapefruit. Quite nice. 4.15",
  "It‚Äôs barrelled , 2-3 minutes. Beautiful berries and üçí. Nice dessert, really. 4.12.",
  "I think it‚Äôs my favourite PM! Merci Renaud B.",
  "Could be thicker, but still delicious. To revisit. 3.8",
  "So very similar to regular Pepsi.",
  "Honest stout, very tart. For a pale ale, it's hardly  the NEIPA type, but it's still quite the NEIPA.",
  "First time in a can. Usually doesn't go well. Creamy coffee, chocolate, vanilla, nutmeg. Gotta get me some more!",
  "Batch 10, released today. Pretty creamy, quite dry. I'd call it that come November (best one in years).",
  "A little harsh, but not too harsh. Tart, refreshing, doesn't disappoint on the nose.    Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Beautiful orange popsicle color. Very good texture, tastes good, fresh... well, almost. 4.35, already overhyped. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Not much texture, very faint acetic aftertaste, rather bitter.",
  "Thin, creamy oatmeal stout. Very nice, but a little thin.",
  "Now trying the first try. Approved!",
  "Very sour, very thin, but not too sour, just sweet enough, you could drink a lot if you had time. Not too tropical.",
  "Cool ‚Äî lots of maple, not too thin, thick, not overly sweet or dry, moderate hop burn, the Messorem way!",
  "Could be a tad sweeter. Coffee and chocolate very close, thin but still pleasant.",
  "Not as saturated as expected from BBC. Nice bourbon and vanilla, slight oak and vanilla. Great saison.",
  "Maybe I've tasted better IPA du Nord-est before. Not sure about you, my fave...",
  "Holy moly! Excellent dessert! üòõ",
  "To me, this is the best PA I‚Äôve ever had. Very fruity, slightly sour, very frothy. Love it!",
  "Tropical, melon, good texture, nice DDH kick. Love those BBC releases! 4.4, downgrading. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "A little frothy, but I like it.",
  "Rich coffee, some bitterness, good mouthfeel. Old school, but rather simple, good bourbon taste, and good mouthfeel. Merci Matthieu L. et Vincent L.",
  "So malty, bitter, hazy, hoppy, no name, but what it ain't...",
  "Oh, let's all forget about NEDIPA #9 üéâüíï",
  "In-your-face cinnamon. Bitter chocolate, disappointing mouthfeel. Boozy. Pretty sweet, but bland.",
  "This is a good one. Beautiful color, very pleasant in the mouth. OG is going up .25. üçç Better than Cassis Bleuet.",
  "This is a very good basic (non barrel aged) stout: rich chocolate and coffee and pretty good mouthfeel. 4.25",
  "Fruit juice with slight hop burn. Interesting, but I prefer my lager sweeter. 4.12/5",
  "Typical Hudson Valley nose, lemon and lime mastery. Definite üçç aftertaste, balsamic, but overwhelmingly so in the mouth. Nice bourbon and coffee.",
  "Juicy, quite frothy, kind of berry, very nice, not as strong as expected. Delicious üòã",
  "I don't watch üçá, but this is one series I'm getting to love... üòé",
  "Major malty, caramel final rather tart, good mouthfeel.  Major coffee pur√©e, significant üçí.",
  "After a flop, this old faithful does the trick üòú",
  "A little old school. A good oatmeal stout. Refreshing.",
  "My 1st QIPA. Medium tartness, nothing special. Just a nice fruity, fruity afternoon. Really like it! Have I had a taster yet?...",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the tongue! üíï",
  "Surprisingly thick for an IPA. Thin, 14.5% ABV. Ok.",
  "Easy 4.1 on the nose. Coffee, bourbon, chocolate, nicely balanced. Very nice.",
  "Fruit, tart, unexpected sourness, a little destabilizing... I love it!",
  "It was offered to me, I wasn't going to say no. Meh... duh!",
  "The consistency, the quality, the unbeatable price. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very frothy nose. Taste is strange, chocolate and bourbon very much present, but not too much. Quite nice. Another delicious beer from the same series!",
  "Can you believe it's late night...",
  "Well balanced, slight almond and chamomile, chocolate is quite subtle. Lovely üòä",
  "Oh lala! Has better stout in Ontario. Creamy and apparently boozy. Pretty good!",
  "Not good, but not as good as the 1st batch. Was going to give 3, but maybe could have 4. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Ah, Yummy, you've finally come out of the closet to assume your real identity: you're an IPA! l knew it all along, Baby! You're the man!",
  "You wouldn't know it's an IPA, the apricot touch. Not too sweet, not too dry, tastes great, despite the relatively new brewery.",
  "Wow!!! IPA du Nord-est!",
  "Nice texture and bourbon barrel, pretty enjoyable. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very sweet, a bit of butter, but I‚Äôd add a dash of vanilla to smooth it out. To forgettable.",
  "Now in the can. A little thin, but... something seems to be missing. Another try... Reminds me of Nickel Brook's Headstock, only better.",
  "Always nice, sure bet. Dry, oaky finish. Mouthfeel is definitely there, as is the beer. A real bonus.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Just crying. Sweet raisin, melon and maybe molasses. Amazing for a slow-growing IPA.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Good raspberry, not too sour, very simple, simply bland... What a drop üòú",
  "The best East Coast IPA... If only it had a home brewpub IPA...",
  "On the sweet side. Very hoppy.",
  "A little flat, but otherwise, a very honest beer. Nice hops.",
  "As good as in August, but better as always!",
  "I love Melon! This is my favourite AWA, if not the best. A real bargain. 4.4/5",
  "Very tasty, better than expected. A little bitter.",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy, with a lovely sense of vanilla.  Delicious. Very good, impressed with this one last night!",
  "Very interesting, different smell, not an IPA, but still nice.",
  "Beginners beer... Not the fruit, but well made and tasty nonetheless. Pretty good, my fave so far. 4.35/5",
  "Aggressive hop blast, distinctive bit from BBC. Good mouthfeel, not as thin as expected. 4.12.",
  "You wouldn't know it's a collab w BBC. Typical Dominion twist, peppery, not much salt, good mouthfeel. Merci Matthieu L. & Vincent L.",
  "Looks like a fresh can.",
  "Powerful. Great mouthfeel., great NEIPA, it's that!",
  "I think they lowered the ABV (a great idea in 2015). Still awesome, Low and behold, DIPAs are still very well above expectations.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Basic pale ale, very delicate, delicate... very pale. It‚Äôs meant to be such a dry good time. Bitter. Not quite as good as last year. Refreshing.",
  "Thinnish hop bill, but tasty. Trace of soap, too. Medium tartness. Merci Vincent L. Matthieu L.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Easily one of the best Hypas. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Bottle this time. It's a fruity JK. A tad too sour, but more than a little boozy. Let me tell you, this is a sour JK, not a NEIPA. Peachy...",
  "Nice raspberry nose, reminds me of old times.",
  "Can you imagine the üçí?",
  "Very sour, not coffee, more sour than non-BA imperial. Very mild, bland.",
  "Chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla and üå∂ all collide, thickened and sweetened by lactose. But tastes a little cheap. Like aspartame? 3.85/5",
  "Very nice tasting coffee, bourbon and light carbonation. Quite nice, but a little thin for this low ABV.",
  "Gusher. Well... discrete lactose, not too sweet, kind of old school, but still fruity, oaky and dry.    Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I'm a bit apprehensive, very delicate. Especially in your nose. üçç. Ok mouthfeel, but very tame. 4.12.",
  "Very light soap, very light mouthfeel, very pleasant, very tropical. But a tad thinner than expected. Merci Renaud B.",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, nothing to stand out. Still enjoyable, though...",
  "Still one of the best sours I‚Äôve ever had, and definitely on tap for TIPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "So sweet, so chocolate, not sure if it's a pale ale, or a boozy stout. Quite nice. Rating's good, not very complex, but still very good.",
  "Tasty and somewhat sweet, it works. Pretty refreshing though. Merci Patrick C.",
  "Pretty sour, hazy, British-style. Not a fan of Porter, which is fruit-forward. This time's pretty nice.",
  "In the can, apparently, above the canning date...",
  "Seems a little more rounded after a couple of weeks, maybe more tame than before.",
  "Not much on the nose. Rather old school. Maple syrup does come out rather well. Sour üçí comes forward quickly too. Downgrading. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Good mouthfeel, as usual for Badlands. This is an IPA, after all. Simplicity is nice here. 4.12",
  "Amazing mouthfeel, from the West Coast to CA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "You could buy this for under $, but it would have been awesome if it was more on the sweet side. A little boring, though.",
  "Quite boozy nose, not that old-school, but still a solid old-school DIPA. Merci Matthieu L. (maybe the best one in the lot)",
  "Very disconcerting. You know, things that used to be expected from HF: good texture, bitter, dank.",
  "Interesting, very citrusy, a little boozy, mint üç≠, woody, very good.",
  "Very nice, good funk, but mild. Thinnish.",
  "Old faithful, first time in a can. 1 week, and I think it's your typical BTP IPA. Very mild, delicate , but still a very good APA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Grape, slight pepper and bitterness, it's all well that way. 3.9/5",
  "You know, for old time's sake. Sticking to 4.4.",
  "So nice after so much grapefruit. So good! Merci Vincent L.",
  "Can only mentions üçç , not lactose, but I guess there is a bit. Hoppy but old school. Merci Matthieu L. (Matatatow)",
  "This is a very good basic (non barrel aged) stout: rich chocolate and coffee and pretty good mouthfeel. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Excellent mouthfeel, as usual for Badlands. This one isn't the most fragrant and aromatic, though. Delicate peach and melon. 4.12",
  "Love the mouthfeel. Throat tingling. Nice coffee and rum. Very nice!",
  "Mmmhhh! This is how I like, erh... love Nelson Sauvin! Dank, great mouthfeel, sweet, uncomplicated. 4.35 üíï",
  "A trip back in time. Pretty decent IPA, not the most melon, but still a serious brew. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "What a dessert! Coffee, chocolate and bourbon mix so well! If only it had the KBS mouthfeel...",
  "My fav Bor√©ale version. Love that hops, though. Stone fruit, though. Merci Matthieu L. et... Renaud?",
  "Rather bitter, ugly (egg?), bitter. Different mouthfeel. Different mouthfeel. Different ABV.",
  "Nice fruit, moderate sourness, not as intense as I would like. Oh! What a mouthfeel! Gros merci Simon L.",
  "Low acidity and tartness. Not very complex, but still complex. Simple syrup and dust. Mouthfeel OK.",
  "Old school... and tasty. Gotta be safe. Fresh can.",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. Ok.",
  "Plum and apricot come out rather well, but acidic spices add a harsh tingle that's hard to get from the plain. Boozier than I remember. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Going up .25. The fruit is delicious, very pleasant. The vanilla is more subtle. Nice.",
  "Very nice, good oak presence, not the most complex one, but interesting. Not the most complex one, but quite nice. 3.85",
  "Raspberry comes out well for me, quite nice. Nice peppery taste, not very complex. Easy drinking. 4.35",
  "The weakling in the pomace family! üíï",
  "This is like going back to when I discovered HF (Abner & Harlan) and Sip of Sunshine. Again, that \"pioneer\" feel, like a piece of history. Thanks Tyson S. Matthieu L.",
  "Could be thicker, but still quite tasty. A good DIPA.",
  "God, I dig Yummy!üòú",
  "Luscious mouthfeel, juicy, not too sweet, dryish-tart. Fresh can.",
  "Doing #10, but you know what you get: üçí, coffee, chocolate. What's not to ‚ù§Ô∏è? Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Harsh, but it's tasty. More than a little spicy. Well... mellow. Merci Matthieu L. Matthieu L.",
  "Fresh can, a little thin, but tasty. Was going to finish it lower, but it's dank, fruity and tasty. Oats help methinks. 3.6",
  "Heineken nose, rather fruity, interesting, but too bitter. Still very nice, KBS. 3.6",
  "Wonderful raspberry! üòã",
  "Very mild, delicate funk, fresh, subtle. Pretty good, would make a good intro beer if done well.",
  "Slightly acidic coffee, hint of salt. Nice dessert, nice.",
  "Very smooth, just the right hint of thyme and chocolate. Lovely.",
  "Hard to beat, sweet coffee and vanilla, but not much mouthfeel. Like a weak Hypa. 4.3 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Light, fluffy, a bit overly sweet. Not familiar with the style, but nice üçí.",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy. Fruity but acidic with a somewhat metallic finish. I don‚Äôt get the butter but I‚Äôd take pride round to use it on a hot summer day... and make it happen. 4.38/5",
  "In the can, maybe because it seems more aged-in than brandy-tired. Old-school, but still tasty and old-school as usual.",
  "Caramel, brandy, trace of smoke. Delicious üòã",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad! 4.25",
  "Amazing berry with a definite sweetness. Creamy, very well made, I‚Äôd go for it!",
  "Citra and Simcoe, tropical, dank, sharp, has more than üçí. Merci Renaud B. et Vincent L.",
  "Fruit, tart, not too sour, brandy, nice.",
  "Very tasty Old school IPA, with a good dose of banana and chocolate. Not too bad.",
  "A little too sour for my liking. This is very Dutch-leaning, with a numbing effect on the palate. A little crude, but not too bad (pepper) üòã 4.15",
  "Not very malty, a little sweet, not overly sweet, not too complex. Very well done! 3.9",
  "Dry, bitter, old school, but still grapefruity, with a nice and fine mouthfeel. It‚Äôs got something to it. Fresh from being overrated! 4.35",
  "Simple raspberry nose. Raspberry nose is more like a berry with a certain sweetness. Rather simple. Nice üçí.",
  "I feel I got hit by a train. Some old-school/West Coast DIPA! Respectable...",
  "Surprisingly thin for ABV (10.3%). Dark chocolate comes forward, hazelnut and vanilla does the job. Well done!",
  "Very frothy, really quite dry. Sweet grapefruit, tropical rum, trace of vanilla, very well balanced. 4.4, I believe it.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot!!! The perfect 4th thing üí©",
  "Very light, definitely a beach beer. The texture is there, though. Coffee and chocolate, that metallic finish, which I can't say I get from the name. Pretty good.",
  "Coffee and sour are like cats and dogs, not a good fit. It works...",
  "I think they lowered the bar a bit, saying it all: refined malt and citrus. ok coffee, but oh so thin! 3.85",
  "Really awesome üëÑ",
  "Lovely mouthfeel, nice bb but not too boozy, light, not too sweet, goes down easy. 4.15 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "In my book, the best emperor after Tiberius. So nice, the cherry on top. So well done.",
  "Canned 2+ months ago (thanks LCBO) but still holding its own. Were it fresh, surely this would be one of the good CA IPAs. 3.6",
  "Not bad, maybe not to be tasted, but not much aftertaste.",
  "Rather crisp, not too sweet. Ok for sushi.",
  "Really nice texture. Peach, really, really nice! üíïüíïüíïüíï",
  "Honest stout, red wine and slight hop burn, quite pleasant, pretty solid.",
  "Really nice texture, very well made. Thanks Tyson S.",
  "Good texture, nice fruit, but not very complex. What I'm getting myself in good hands...  Yummy! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Vague hops and low bitterness, of which mouthfeel is almost perfect. Low carbonation. Good balance. 4.15",
  "Hazelnut and chardonnay, dank and boozy, not too watery, just a very good Irish big beer.",
  "Don't want to go down. But not before getting my hands on the juicy DIPA. So nice! A little complex, but well made and tasty!",
  "A little disappointing given the price and the expectation. A little full of cheap, old school and depressing. Well done.",
  "Uncharacteristically mild for SPBW. Discreet hops, medium carbonation. Not my fave, but better than Cuv√©e Ren√©!",
  "WTF 27. Scrumptious fruit, nice funk. A classy Sunsplit. 4.35",
  "Not bad, rather old school. Yummy. Merci S√©bastien B. & Vincent L.",
  "Odd coffee and vanilla taste, but not much finish. Like a light, but still excellent summer beer. SPBW, merci beaucoup Vincent L. Matthieu L.",
  "Scrumptious candy sugar on the nose, and in the mouth. Better mouthfeel than I remember. Good raspberry and chocolate, particularly aftertaste. Mouthfeel quite enjoyable. This is a good style, I'm liking it even more than I remember. Love this newcomer brewery",
  "Rather complex, anyway. Some tartness and acidity, some bite. Very good. 4.20.",
  "Coffee and sour are like cats and dogs, not a good fit. It works.",
  "Very mild, slight funk and dust, just the right oak presence. Good AF.",
  "Scotch. Very hoppy. I don't know this style well, but I like it anyway. Awesome hop bill. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Do they call it an IPA? No, this is an IPA! One of the best in their price range. Merci Patrick C.",
  "Complex, delicate, delicate... pretty disappointing.",
  "Not very complex, other than that it‚Äôs pretty. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "A little malty, a little hoppy, I don't know if it's natural or not. Pretty dry. All right.",
  "It was offered to me... so did everyone else. OK, maybe not for a BBC, but...",
  "Could have been 4. much better. Quite enjoyable.",
  "The best emperor and we're very, very close!",
  "Name says it all, sour saison. Brett saisons do a good job of that style, although this one doesn't quite add character to it.",
  "Very nice, pleasant discovery, vinous, tropical. Quite original!",
  "üçí üçí üçí üç∑ üç∑... Very sweet and rich. It is from CA. So-so ü§ò",
  "Wow! Tropical blast! Merci Simon L.",
  "Ah, Yummy, here comes the crazy good old school DIPA! I would classify it as a real NEIPA, not a side effect. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "It's got BBC DIPA on the nose. A little malty, bitter and bitter, but well made. Looking forward to their 4th NEIPA!",
  "AFAIK, IPA. Delicate isn't it? Merci Vincent L.",
  "Not bad, but Somewhat weak. I like the taste. 3.85.",
  "Huge coffee! Fruit stout, but with a slight leather note. Dominion seems a little more subdued than Brewskey. 4.1/5",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic today, it's a no-brainer! It isn't the most fragrant or dank, it probably has a purpose, but it's not a must try. 4.38 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Dessert üçí üçí üíï, this time in a scotch ale üòú Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice Creamy texture, a little sweet but quite powerful. Pretty good.",
  "Very tame üçí, nice grape, but not overly sour. Fresh can.",
  "Could be a little stronger, but it's still a nice summer beer. Rating's bang on. 4.35",
  "Malty, sour and lumpy. It's got that typical Dominion nose, but forgot about the hoppy side. Nice.",
  "Mmmhhh... delicious!",
  "Tropical, melon, good texture, nice kick. Could be a little stronger, but still a good option for a sunny, wet Friday afternoon. 4.15",
  "Very fruity, a little more cherry-ish than Framboise. Good balance. So sweet, delicate and original!",
  "Not very raw, not much tropical fruit, not much hop burn, pretty dry. My first white wine. Quite fresh. 4.12.",
  "Jalape√±o on the nose! A little sour, but rather obvious on the palate. Delicious!  Almost dessert! Merci Renaud B. et Vincent L.",
  "Oh yeah! Tropical greatness!",
  "Nice Pale ale, very delicate and subtle. Well balanced and pleasant unexpected carbonation. Well thought-out. Dry, refined and technically great.",
  "1st time in a can... Very sweet, a little more barrelly than others, but still an extreme one. Not a style I'm familiar with. 4.15",
  "Very tasty Sabro. Gros merci S√©bastien B. et Vincent L.",
  "Coffee, prune, chocolate, bitter, very nice.  Now I know how a hungry dog feels about sugar cookies...",
  "Light, fluffy, quite malty, good mouthfeel. Not too shabby! BBC... Yup! üçí",
  "Simply funky, very mellow, not into stouts, but this one‚Äôs a treat.",
  "Smokey AF. Quite pleasant but could have more mouthfeel. Good hop, for the style.",
  "Gusher. So refreshing. Quite orange and a little bitter. That's all I'm say.",
  "Surprisingly thin, light, ok mouthfeel, but I'm a lightweight in texture and character. Could be thicker, but still quite satisfying.",
  "Nice Bourbon nose. Greenish, but thin.",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad! Just saying. 4.1",
  "Refreshing, nice sour AF. Slight oak taste, but definitely more sour. Yummy. 3.9",
  "Doesn't taste like 9% ABV. Tastes pretty generic.",
  "Last I checked, the best APAs are those with the most carbonation. And this is the best one I've had from OH. 3.9/5",
  "Hazy, dank, tropical, lemongrass with a trace of lemon. Nice hops. A touch of lime is nice. Easy drinking, in a cool, single-hop beer.",
  "Very interesting type of üçí, tropical, quite bitter, quite bitter, maybe a little old school for this new school Pilsner?",
  "Thinnish, but tasty. Almost a pale ale. It works. Easy drinking, thanks Tyson S.",
  "Low-key smoke, good texture, nice %. Some bitterness. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Lusciously fruity, funky, creamy. Not much tongue-tickling aftertaste.",
  "Honest stout, very bitter, old school. I have a couple of cans, hope you enjoy them all!",
  "Very good coffee, just wish there were less coconut. üç≠ on point. 4.1",
  "Surprising witbier. Very fruity, melon, tickles tongue. Discreet üçí and fruit. Always nice!",
  "Watered down apple juice. It tastes good, but has the typical Dominion sourness. Nice!",
  "Could be sweeter. Good texture, green, but oh so gradual...",
  "Really good mouthfeel, BBA, very peppery, the pepper comes through quite well. Boozy. Not bad.",
  "Good hop bill, nice texture, nice üçí, but the vanilla does get in the way. Very disappointing.",
  "Huge jam nose. At 10% ABV, it‚Äôs pretty malty. If you want more bite, this is it. 3.6",
  "Not that bad, you know, for a single IPA.",
  "Easy peach porter to make on a hot summer day. Crisp, dry, not too acidic or anything. Merci Patrick C.",
  "Shall I call it Old Faithful? The first real Hypa, and one of the best. The Ontario yeast that I know, and you, too, are one of the very best in the country. üíïüíïüíïüíï",
  "Not bad for an English-style IPA, not much to do in the summer.",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad! Great mouthfeel, hops, tropical. I would buy this again, more than a month old, if it holds up.",
  "Hop nose, sweet but not overly bitter, follows through with peach pit aftertaste.",
  "Thin stouts, a little heavy, but good hop combination. Nice.",
  "Pleasantly surprised, better than most IPA du Nord-est offerings. More sour than expected, better too!",
  "Maybe the best texture on tap. Good hop burn, for the style. Merci Renaud B. et Vincent L.",
  "Holy moly that's ABV! Interesting to compare, I've never tasted anything this good in a non-BA stout.",
  "Surprisingly thin, exactly what I was expecting. Slightly sweet, not too bitter, white wine, really that good",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. The mouthfeel is there, though. 4.15.",
  "Very sour, very piney. Pretty good.",
  "Wow! Love this JK! Very different from most other PMs I've had. Serious DIPA! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Always nice, sure bet. Dry ale, very delicate. Quite nice!",
  "Bitter, raspy and gritty, packs a sharp bite. Could be thicker, but still quite satisfying. 3.6",
  "It's a porter, apparently, but that's only the coffee layer. A bit thin, but pretty decently bitter.",
  "Surprisingly smooth. Bourbon barrel is it‚Äôs significant. Nice.",
  "Ah, why not, good old Sunsplit. Best offering, thanks Tyson S.",
  "Grossly underrated, yet amazing every time. Fresh can.",
  "I think this is my favourite Bellwoods IPA. It's got that harsh West Coast turn I so wish it had. Tickles the throat üòã",
  "Good mouthfeel, typical of BBC. Refreshing, you'd think it had 4. much better options for a mouthfeel than Coke. I say 3.85.",
  "I think this batch is a little sulphurous. I prefer my stouts more tropical. Good nose, tropical. Amazing for the style. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Well, actually, it's pretty good. Quite a bit better than I remember, f you don't have to dig too far...",
  "Dry finish, but I'm low on sour beers...",
  "Didn't realize I was buying 1-month old cans (merci IGA Extra)... Not sure I get the roasted sugar. Going up .25",
  "Really nice NEIPA, refreshing on a hot spring day. Chocolate, coffee and bourbon. Hoppy!",
  "Decent IPA, even if it was a great one. Nice little saison, would get a little sweet from brett. 4.12 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad! Merci Matthieu L. et Vincent L.",
  "Probably the best porter I've had. Delicious and affordable!",
  "Yes, 2-week old can. OG is very much my-take-no!",
  "Straddles the boundary btw OS IPA and NEIPA. Pretty sweet, but delivers the punch. Merci Matthieu L. Matthieu L. 4.3",
  "I'm pleasantly surprised for a non-BA imperial stout. Thin, bitter, not very hoppy, lacking in mouthfeel, a bit of carbonation. Well, almost. 3.85",
  "OK gueuze, faint peach and apple, not very complex, but still an IPA. More than a PA, a great PA! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Oh, shut up, you're the cheddar expert! I mean: saturated fat, resinous, tropical fruit, very good!",
  "Disappointing, the way Liquid Art was. Peach and the hops used just don't mix that well. Pleasant and refreshing.",
  "Scrumptious chocolate, cognac, bourbon, coffee, slight.... oh! so................... bitter. Quite sour, but not overly sweet. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Surprisingly smooth, I may have had it less than a week ago. So-so texture, good bourbon smoke, close to 9%. Boozy. I actually use it everyday! 3.9",
  "Simple Bellwoods nose. Fruity, red, but more like a blonde with a little something different. Nice.",
  "This is very duh, very nice. I dig the raspberry. Comfort raspberry, not too sour. Great at pairing up with sushi.",
  "The most classic Cantillon from Bas-Canada. Refreshing, yeasty.",
  "Very mellow red grape and grapefruit, with a hint of salt. Quite nice. 4.3 Merci Renaud B.",
  "Not too bad, thinnish, not that unique. Still lovely, but [...]",
  "Wow! Love it! So smooth. Amazing mouthfeel, love üçí. Amazing when cold.",
  "Complex. Sometimes I like it sweeter and mellower, but this one seems a little thin.",
  "I think they overdid it. Too much cereal, too much sugar, too much cinnamon. Very bitter. Really nothing to compare to...",
  "Maybe I'm getting old...",
  "Fruit, tart, citrusy, rather bitter, shy of KBS.",
  "Very sour, very piney. Quite pleasant in my book (Bourbon). Thanks Tyson S.",
  "Coffee, prune, chocolate, bitter, quite hoppy.  Yes!",
  "Very nice, good mouthfeel, slightly tart, coffee too. My fave from Collective Arts. Very nice!",
  "Canned 1 month ago, so it could be fresher. Still very nice, it ain‚Äôt.",
  "Quite boozy nose, not so much on the palate. Good coffee and taffy, but could use a tad more mouthfeel. Nice.",
  "A little flat, but not very complex, anything but. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "A little crude, but good SPBW signature. West Coast, not too sour.",
  "Serious coffee! Chocolate, vanilla and cognac. Pretty good, price üí• tank üòú",
  "A little thin, but classy.",
  "A little thin, but good frothy, with maybe a hint of chocolate.",
  "All right, and rather fizzy as usual.",
  "More bitter than I'd like. If only it had something to do with the IPA.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! I would have preferred a sweeter version, but still...",
  "Slight funk, dust, üå∂, but very little mouthfeel. Quite frothy. Very stupid tasting!",
  "Refreshing, very sour, but with a trace of sugar, and quite good malt. If only it had the KBS mouthfeel...",
  "Very light, definitely a beach beer. Slightly hoppy, a little revved up.",
  "This is a relatively fresh batch. I can barely taste the base, which is probably because I don't taste the wax. Whatever it is, it's tasty. Used to be my favorite from Small Pony.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very nice, good hop burn, not the most extravagant, yet refreshing. Almost dessert. 4.2. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Dry, bitter, old school, but still chocolate. Almost a fruit dessert. 4.12.",
  "Tropical, melon, good texture, nice DDH kick. Strong, want more! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nose is all caf√©. In the mouth, coffee right away, then vanilla. In the throat, right away, then more comfortably with coffee, vanilla and bourbon. Good mouthfeel. 4.35, ever so slightly. Thanks Tyson S. Matthieu L.",
  "Hazelnut comes forward first, then cinnamon, chocolate, maybe blueberry. Bourbon, probably the most subtle, yet the best  raspberry  I've had so far. Good balance. 4.15",
  "Very sour, very British. Doesn't disappoint on the mouth. Another great DIPA from the masters!",
  "Honest stout, very tart, fresh, refreshing... not quite 9. but well... the money makes it interesting. üíï",
  "Serious stuff, first time! Going up .25",
  "Name says it all, sour saison. Brettish, dryish... fourish...?",
  "Still very nice, although getting a little tired (I love old school). 4.25",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Easily the best batch ever. Tropical, dank, juicy! Will be awesome again.",
  "Too much bitterness, very light, well, dessert. Bitter, better than I thought. 3.9",
  "Dark AF! Mega coffee milkshake! Toffee, coconut, coffee, ‚òïÔ∏èÔ∏è coffee, ‚òïÔ∏èÔ∏è coffee! This is not a dessert stout, not a porter, not a stout, not boozy, not boozy either! Amazing mouthfeel, deceptively nice. Very well made. 4.4",
  "Really not bad. Fruity, citrusy, good funk. Upping it a notch, a day or two down, it's still not a show-off. Worth your while!",
  "Surprisingly thick for a can.",
  "So creamy. All day IPA! Merci Simon L.",
  "Seems a little thinner than I remember, maybe because of the TIPA reference. Heavy on the sugar, but not overly sweet.",
  "Never tasted before. Pleasant, refreshing, not much bitterness. Refreshing. Nice on a sunny June afternoon. 4.15",
  "Smells like dessert! Nice dessert, not too sour, slight hops, very well done! 3.6",
  "Simple single hop, citrusy, bitter, woody. Pretty good, happy to find this at the LCBO! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Really nice texture. Peachy, but also boozy, pointing westward. This is very good. 4.12.",
  "Very mild, just shy of #500. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Good mouthfeel, very old school (?). Grapefruit and citrus. Quite acidic. Original. Love this little guy!",
  "Simple, light, almost no harshness. Ok, nothing more. 3.9",
  "This is a fairly traditional stout, the tamest Los T can say it all. Up .25 yet again.",
  "A little short in the mouthfeel department, but hey! It‚Äôs an icon! And at $6.50, it‚Äôs a no-brainer. Merci BBC! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Seems a little more tame Grapefruit-ish than IPA du Nord-est. Good  mouthfeel, but could be thicker. 4.15.",
  "A little too frothy. Really not bad,  little old-school IPA crap...",
  "Nice mouthfeel, coffee, chocolate, very nice. Intense. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Surprisingly smooth. Nice barrel and rather dry finish. Pretty good.",
  "Powerful, depressing, but also sensible üíï. Fresh can.",
  "It's a pils... A nice little sour pils. Quite similar to an IPA I had a couple of months ago, isn't it?",
  "Batch #8. Dry hop on the nose. Trace of wood, dust. Pleasant. Almost a grain, more hops than bitterness. Quite enjoyable üíïüíï",
  "Le Merci Matthieu L.",
  "You wouldn't know it's a saison, let alone a... Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Good mouthfeel. Not big on sours, but this is the best one I've had from them so far. Nice texture, well made.",
  "Not great, but better than Beyond the Pale's standard survival style Brett.",
  "Nose is all coffee. In the mouth, coffee right away, then trace of vanilla and cinnamon. Nice and fresh. Bitter, hoppy! 4.12/5",
  "You wouldn't know it's a collab w BBC. Typical Dominion harshness and oniony bite. Boozy. Nothing to do w BBC mastery AND the potential for a great NEIPA.",
  "Supposed to be light, but maybe a tad sweeter than expected. Nice.",
  "Pleasantly surprised, better than most IPA du Nord-est offerings. Not bad, if a little hoppy. Almost 4.",
  "Honest stout, alright... not very dry, but still dank, ok for a thin, old-school IPA. Oak is very present. 3.65",
  "Slight trace of balsamic vinegar, quite enjoyable üíï",
  "So smooth, so creamy, so üçí. So much better than regular Jelly King. üíï",
  "Sticking to 3.75, even if it meant sticking to a thinner stout.",
  "Nice little sour raspberry PA. Pleasant. 6%... Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very frothy nose, chocolate and coffee. Finish is a little thin. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "A bit sharper than Low Carbonation. Delicious üòã",
  "Look old school enough for yah? Merci Vincent L.",
  "Definitely not as clean as I remember. 3.85",
  "Surprisingly thin for ABV (10.3%). Dark chocolate comes forward, hazelnut and vanilla is more discrete. Good, though something‚Äôs missing. 3.9",
  "I think they overrated it. It was supposed to be 8%, but it ain't.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Wow!!! Luscious coffee, delicate... delicious summer brew! Almost 4.5.",
  "Coffee, bitter and earthy, but not overly sweet, either way. Plum is very present. Reminds me of Passion Fruit. Simple, easy drinking...",
  "Ah, Yummy, you've finally come out of the closet to assume your real identity: you're an IPA! l knew it all along, Baby. You're the queen! You're the man!",
  "Harsh. Very light and maybe a tad sweet. Mmmmhhhhhh!!! Oh lala! So much better than APA! Similar. Better than most.",
  "Huge bourbon nose! Grape, peach and apple. A little too sour for me. Good texture. The place is very discreet. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Intense coconut nose follows on the palate. Trace of butter. Very tropical. Almost dessert. It's lovely!",
  "Bitter, je ne suis, je suis, stopper. And again, more sugar and booze than wine. It's good, but gives way a bit as the brew turns .25.",
  "Coffee and vanilla. Quite delicate, but delivers the goods: raspberries. Would be more enthused, but it deserves its 4. I say 3.9",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy. Fruity, but I just wish the vanilla was more intense. Still enjoyable, it tastes like  kinda candy.",
  "A little old school. A little sweet. Nothing stands out. Old school, but Coke and Pepsi probably mix well.",
  "Very creamy, more or less Moka, more barbecued than HHOE. I prefer it stronger, malty, more sour. Very nice.",
  "Malty, balsamic, slightly lemony. Great mouthfeel, resinous, nice. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Good mouthfeel, pretty sour, not overly sweet, cereal, nice finish.",
  "Surprisingly smooth, I was expecting something harsher from Berliner. Nice, easy drinking, next time.",
  "4.25? Again, the üçí. Did I mention the üçí? They threw a punch gun at it, yah? Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice chocolate nose. Sweet, not too tart but not too much. Intense.",
  "Very nice, the vanilla is nice, but the coffee is not very balanced. A mistake. 4.12/5 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice Citra nose, which follows through in the mouth. Nice bourbon and vanilla touch. Nice balance. Great brewery.",
  "Good mouthfeel, typical DIPA delish: coffee, cocoa and rich coffee taste.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I think this time, BTP's pretty much nailed it. Harsh, crude, but it comes out nicely. Tasty. 4.1 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice texture, nice bourbon barrel, not overdone. Could definitely be sweeter. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Too sour and flat. On purpose. OK mouthfeel. 4.4, downgrading it a notch.",
  "Pleasant candy and a trace of cinnamon. Interesting.",
  "Ah, Yummy, you're The Best kind of IPA üôÉ",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Bitter aftertaste that makes you believe it's meant business! Yet it does have a purpose: in our beer world, üçé. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Not that familiar with the style, but it's still very nice. 4.15",
  "More sour than your typical Berliner. Raspberry jam, rather dry. Pretty decent, if rather conventional.",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy, from the can to the final one. Some harshness, even for a gueuze like Alchemist. Much lager!",
  "Old school, I swear. Canned June 6.",
  "Nose is all coffee. In the mouth, coffee right away, then trace of vanilla and cinnamon. Nice. Finish with a üçí.",
  "Still great, quality beer, but this is the best one I've had from them. 3.6",
  "Easy 2nd date, like so many others in my life. Nice barrel, nice notes of grape juice, and that hint of salt, which abates the bitterness. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very sweet and generous, raisin, coffee, very well made. 4.4",
  "I wouldn't mix delicate kiwi with guava, but I think it's just good hop burn and mellowness would make it a nice pairing. 4.15",
  "Nice dry hop. Fruity. Sour. In your face! Dominion‚Äôs only PA, but it does the job!",
  "Very good texture, nice tingling on the tongue, another great surprise from BBC. 4.4",
  "Not my thing. Overly sour for not'n. No bitterness, other than as a side to sushi.",
  "I feel I've seen enough of their IPAs. This is one of their best.",
  "Vaguely reminds me of my school years.  3.85",
  "Now in a can, I'm a big fan! Very creamy, better than Bourbon. This is one of their best-rated IPAs, if not the best. 4.35",
  "A trip back in time. Pretty fucking awesome üëè",
  "I don't know enough about hops, but this is my first IPA, and I wouldn't change it. Better than most IPA du Nord-Est batches of late. Very nice! 4.2/5",
  "Really ‚ù§Ô∏è this one.  Merci Vincent L.",
  "Really nice texture. Peach, papaya. Similar to a Hill Farmstead IPA. 4.12/5",
  "A weak Pilsner, maybe too bitter for my liking. The brown ale side is quite nice and quite bretty, rather dry, which is nice. Still very drinkable, but lightweight. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Solid Pale Ale, hazy, not too sour. Quite nice, I'll have lots more for sure!",
  "My taffy last. Had it on tap earlier in the year from Small Pony, still prefer. Mouthfeel OK. IPA still wins this fight! 4.3",
  "Simple, light, but tasty dry hop juice. Very nice. 4.12",
  "Delicious, of course. Chocolate, üçç and passion fruit. Quite bitter, although with less bitterness than expected (which I can appreciate when it warms up). Intense.",
  "This is bitter and malty, very unusual for a NEIPA. Quite a good old school DIPA.",
  "The tamest Los T, and the tamest Bellwoods. Great mouthfeel, great hop bill. Best Bellwoods IPA (not a home brew) I've had. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Another good stout, just as good as the previous one. Merci Patrick C.",
  "A little thin, but well made and delicious. Would be delicious on a sunny spring day. 4.15",
  "I think this is the best gueuze I've had so far in a PA. Very fruity, acetic. Definitely on point. 4.35",
  "Expected a little better from BBC. Nice intro to a new era in beer.",
  "Ah, Yummy, you've finally come out of the closet to assume your real identity: you're an IPA! l knew it all along, Baby, you're the queen! You're the best fucking IPA you've ever tasted! You're the king! You're the king! You're the best fucking real IPA you've had! Respect!",
  "Very nice aroma. Not too sour, it‚Äôs a no go, delicious!",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. Boozy. Ok.",
  "In-your-face cinnamon. Bitter chocolate, disappointing mouthfeel. Bourbon ü•É is discrete. Why? Because of the cacao and the rum. Thin-ish.",
  "Simple pils. Good BA mouthfeel. Very good value for $. Merci Simon L.",
  "Never thought a pils could be such a good thing. Carbonation, for one, is welcome in a Russian take on an IPA. And the silky texture is definitely there in the mouth. 4.3",
  "Good texture, slightly boozy, tastes like natural yeast. Pretty good, would be great for a bar with good barley wine. 4.15",
  "Pretty typical Quebec IPA, surprisingly thin for the type. Nice though.",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. Yeah! Mouthfeel OK, but shy of KBS. 4.12.",
  "Luscious mouthfeel, tropical, even if it's summer. Yummy, quite cold, but where's the passion fruit? Boozy.",
  "I love this sour IPA du Nord-est. It's got something to it.",
  "Heaps of 7 different hops! Excellent mouthfeel, tropical, but too much of that raw bite √† la Dominion City. 4.12. Merci Simon L.",
  "Not bad, good malt, some bitterness, quite \"high\", but much, much lower. 3.9",
  "Doing quality control on my survival stash. 1st time in a can, 3.88",
  "Seems harsher than I remember. Reminds me of Nickel Brook's Headstock, maybe a tad smoother. Still a good value.",
  "Fruit juice, tartness and bitterness welcome, not too sour, just tart enough, not too sour, well balanced, of course!",
  "Seems to have more bite than #GiT, maybe not as ‚Äúperfect‚Äù (Strata to blame here???), but tasty nonetheless with a good texture.",
  "Like a double Sunsplit; in a Pepsi challenge, I beat them all to one single drink. No need to be the expert!",
  "Simple single hop, barely tart, kind of BTP, piney, citrusy, pretty frothy. üçí, dank, juicy. Fresh can.",
  "Subtle, delicate, quite malty, good mouthfeel. Dessert üçí. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "OS AF but not bad.",
  "Rather acidic, not that much berry.",
  "Hoppy, citrusy, good balance. Quite nice, but I had higher expectations. 4.15",
  "Very good saison, very much so. A little hoppier than I'd like. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Quite boozy nose, not so much on the palate. Good BA stout, but nothing more. 4.12/5",
  "Batch #7. Throat tingling. Discreet Bourbon. Very nice!",
  "Simple lager, really not bad. Not too sour, that kind of shut-off. Pretty good, thank God. 3.9",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. The mouthfeel is there, though. OK.",
  "V. 2017. A little thin, but well made.",
  "Nice Bourbon nose. Fruit, old school. Well done, not as good as their best one, but still an excellent old-school IPA.",
  "Cool IPA and a great one for an unbeatable Jutsu: delicious, if a tad crude. Respect!",
  "Simple Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. The mouthfeel is ok, but the mouthfeel is a bit crude. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice bourbon and coffee touch, good mouthfeel. Quite tropical. 4.15. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Second try, I confirm it's a fucking TIPA. Not as good as I remember it...",
  "The best PA I've ever tasted, the best being 4.6. Tremendous nose, love it in JK üòò",
  "All right, and rather fizzy, of course. Good bitterness and roasted malt. Merci Matthieu L. et... Vincent L.",
  "Last night. Maybe because I had another amazing one last night. One of the best ones I've had from BBC. Tasty, but I expected more",
  "Awesome mouthfeel, sweet enough, it tastes like juice, a little tart, maybe a bit peachy, I like. üíï",
  "Citra and Simcoe, tropical, dank, sharp, has some bite. One of those forgettable IPAs that they may or may not be in 2017. Good times before 'em.",
  "It's got the Bellwoods nose üòú",
  "Basically a Lightning Field with üçí and vanilla. The vanilla is just nice enough and fairly dry. Pretty good, my fave from Small Pony.",
  "Simple little sour P√©ch√© stone fruit and apricot. Rather tart, bearing in mind it's a session. 3.6.",
  "Very sour, rather ordinary, not much color, tastes like a lambic. Apparently fresher?",
  "In my opinion, the best Sabro so far. Great balance, in character for the style.",
  "Mmmhhhhh!!! DDH (impeccably done) with Nelson Sauvin ü•∞ . These guys rule! üíï",
  "Ah, Yummy, you've finally come out of the closet to assume your real identity: you're a fanboy!",
  "5 weeks old. Sweet, not too bitter, gooseberry. Can‚Äôt tell when it‚Äôs barrel-aged, tastes just as good as the first batch. Thanks Tyson S.",
  "Citra, Galaxy and Mosaic are always a good combination! I could go wrong with just them all. 3.9",
  "Coffee and vanilla. Quite pleasant.",
  "Medium-high acidity, nice üçí, and maybe a little malty, but otherwise pretty much the same. Merci Patrick C.",
  "Nice hops, tropical, nice üçí. Well balanced. Well done.",
  "Really nice texture, nice üçí, but the coffee seems to be too discrete.",
  "I wonder if they meant it that way. BTP seems more an amber ale, not much more. Nice hops. Merci Matthieu L. et... Renaud?",
  "Kind of dust, not that thick and dry, but you wouldn't know it.  Yummy üòé",
  "Second decent NEIPA, best one so far from Bellwoods. Not quite as good as I remember.",
  "Very good coffee, just sweet enough. Not too fizzy, i.e. not too bad.",

  "Very nice, not too sour, meh. 4.1/5. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Slightly metallic green when wet, kind of salty, but nicely complemented by a touch of maple. No disappointment here from BBC.",
  "Beautiful dark yellow haze. Rather old school, piney, bitter and frothy (calls for a slow pour). Not very complex (it‚Äôs a single-hop ‚Äî Amarillo ‚Äî pale ale), but it‚Äôs enjoyable. 3.9/5 Merci Patrick C.",
  "You wouldn't know it's a collab w BBC. Typical Dominion harshness and oniony bite. Mouthfeel OK, w . lager...",
  "Really not bad, but a little thin.",
  "Tart, jammy, refreshing, superb!",
  "Great mouthfeel, simply named. Dry finish. Amazing for a single IPA. üëÉ",
  "A little too dank for me, peaty.",
  "Coffee and vanilla. Good mouthfeel. Not too shabby! 4.12/5",
  "Hard to find better than this. So sweet, tropical and almost hazy. So hard to beat!",
  "A little sickly sweet, too much dulce + spicy bar. No mouthfeel or finish. Almost boozy. Good bitterness but slight hop burn. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Simple all-around great NEIPA, nice little piney and tropical taste, not too fruit-heavy. Would drink it alone, though. Gin and taffy all day.",
  "Man, this is good. Long live King KBS!",
  "Citra & Mosaic, bourbon & chocolate, funk, grain, very nice. Starting to get the OH vibe ü§î",
  "Very sour, very piney. Rather sweet. Reminds me of Passion Fruit, but a tad less sweet. A good start. 4.15",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. Overly elaborate.",
  "OK English-type bomb, not as intense as I remember.",
  "The JK does it's thing. Great mouthfeel, nice sourness and bitter and dankness. 4.4. Merci Vincent L. Matthieu L.",
  "Was going to ‚ù§Ô∏è this one. But melon and chocolate, change is slow. 4.15",
  "Good mouthfeel, vinous, nice. A great intro to sour. Sour üçí, oaky, which follows through in the mouth. Ok for sushi.",
  "New batch! Hazy, hoppy, very tropical. I'd call that working. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very creamy, more or than a little boozy. This is good, if a little out of this world. 4.38. Merci Vincent L.",
  "Seems a little thinner than I remember, good mouthfeel, green, slight pepper and berry. Gotta finish my check!",
  "My fav Bor√©ale version. Love this hop combo! Amazing for a pale Monday night. Would be more enthused in the afternoon, but it seems to be on the nose. Good texture. Another good one from BBC...",
  "Fruit! Almost bitter, but balanced by a touch of salt. Ok.",
  "Grape, delicate, not overly sour. Quite nice.",
  "Old-schoolish, not a true NEIPA, but still a very good quality Baltic porter, seems to have fizzled out a bit. Nice scotch ale.",
  "Very light, definitely a beach beer. Slightly hoppy, not that tropical.",
  "I think this is the best Trillium I've had so far. Crazy easy, 3.88",
  "Honest stout, ok bourbon, not very creamy. Dry finish. Well made, nice little summer beer...",
  "Outstanding! Small Pony, the king of small hops! Beautiful color and very natural hop burn, the Bellwoods APA is an exceptional national beer.",
  "You bet! Wine, chocolate and bourbon. Lovely.",
  "Mmmmhhhhhh!!! Me gusta blanc! Merci beaucoup Matthieu L. Un petit miracle que l'affaire!",
  "Nice light strawberry, good mouthfeel. Not too shabby, it could be a little fruit-heavy. 4.15 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Heineken DNA... very mild, to be taken with a grain of salt. 3.7",
  "Coffee and chocolate blend, with the hint of coriander. Quite nice. Would prefer, though, if the coconut were a little more subtle.",
  "Mmmmhhh! This is what OS is made of... delicious wine, malt and acidity, but oh so thin! Oh well...",
  "Dank, slightly boozy, tropical, rather bitter. Very nice!",
  "Less puckering than I remember. Good balance, in the mouth, tongue, and as it warms up, a little flat. Approved. üçç",
  "Fruity Fruity, that's all I got. Alas, it was canned in 3 days üòê .",
  "Not bad, but Somewhat watery. I was expecting more jam. 3.85",

  "Not bad, but Somewhat watery. I was expecting more jam. 3.85.",
  "Well balanced, delicate and subtle. Different makers taste better than I did. üíï",
  "Surprisingly thin for ABV (10.3%). Dark chocolate comes forward, hazelnut & bourbon are more discrete. Still very good, eh? 4.35",
  "Doesn't taste like 11% ABV. Rather old school...",
  "Quite boozy nose, not for the faint of heart, but a true stout, with chocolate and coffee.",
  "I think this is my favourite IPA from their series. Birra di Sardinia with juicy mango and passion fruit. Quite good for the style. Almost 4.25",
  "Delicious fruit pur√©e (guava-dominant), sweet, luscious, with a little bit of coconut. Yummy!",
  "Apricot and booze, porter and more bitterness than fruit. It's true...",
  "Unwelcome carbonation. Barrel very present. Not much coconut. Thin. Carbonation really spoils it. Kinda like rum ‚Äòn Coke. Merci Matthieu L. , pas d√©√ßu!",
  "Wow! Nice dessert! Very refreshing, but still 4.25.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nicely refreshing, good texture, does have a little something to do with the hops used, seems a little more malted than the last time. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Not very complex, but interesting. Drier than expected, probably because of the price. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Coffee, prune, chocolate, bitter and taffy, not overly sweet. Was going to give 3.75, but ok for 3.88",
  "This is quite subtle, but I like it.",
  "This is very sour, very coarse. They say don't look at the bottle, don't! It's a sour version of Monogamy. Too sour!?!?",
  "Thick, dank, juicy. Citrusy and a little bitter for a NEIPA, but still interesting.",
  "After so many great NEIPAs, this one's done. OK. 3.65",
  "Too sour and uninteresting for me, more like a session. Reminds me of Nickel Brook's Headstock, only stronger",
  "I like it better than I did 6 months ago. Nice stout, Bas-Canada's bang for your buck. 4.35, Merci Matthieu L.",
  "It's got the Bellwoods nose üòä. Has the Nelson Sauvin and Citra mouthfeel. Nice! 4.12/5",
  "Really nice texture, very refreshing, and it actually is üíï",
  "In your face at first. Nice coffee. But quickly gets asked down below. Traditional West-Coast style, but good texture and bitterness. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "More stout than IPA, more oniony, dank, slightly piney. Gosh, those guys  often get old...",
  "Not that different from other Trailways IPAs we've tried so far. Nice hops, slight hop burn, it goes without saying that this is an IPA!",
  "Flat, oak, bitter, not too dry. Really not bad, if not the best IPA around.",
  "Holy milkshake! Creamy, hazy, tropical. And in a no-nonsense, no-nonsense way!",
  "Greenish, bitter, peppery. Rather old school, which I could be wrong. Ok.",
  "Nice mouthfeel. Discreet Bourbon, nice touch of salt. Good balance. 4.12.",
  "Supposed to be DDH, tropical fruit, bitter. Not too shabby, maybe a tad harsh, goes down easy. 3.9",
  "Bourbon forward coffee, but it gets a little thin. Ok.",
  "Quite acidic, but Serious isn't bad. Peach, grapefruit, acidity. The creamy consistency feels natural. Nice.",
  "Maybe the best batch of P√©ch√© Mortel...",
  "Serious DIPA. Pineapple and chocolate. Perfect balance. Approved.",
  "Sweet, fruity, overly sweet. Dominion nose is unmistakable. Good balance. 4.15",
  "Upping it a notch, it has more bite than it did. Getting flatter and flatter which is good, I'm not complaining, just saying... Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Old school, some bitter and some sweet. Oh! What a nice fruity (passion fruit) üíï",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy. Fruity, but I had higher expectations. A superior NEIPA.",
  "Mmmmhhhhhh!!! The definition of balance! Delicious fruit presence, balanced by a fair bit of wood. Complex. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Good texture, very delicate... or very strong one.",
  "Doesn't taste like 9% ABV. Hopefully it won't taste bitter anyway. Nice hops.",
  "Honest stout, alright. Pretty solid.",
  "A little too sour for my liking. A little sweet, but... something's wrong.",
  "Rather acidic, funk, dust, apple. Pretty solid.",
  "Surprisingly well done. One of the best mainstream IPAs in MTL.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "It's a porter, not a stout. More an ale, but a decent stout, although not as much. Well rounded.",
  "Greenish, bitter, piney, saying a Bellwoods üçØ: malt, sugar, malt, malt, very nice mouthfeel. A little thin, but would still rate it higher. Merci Matthieu L. et... Vincent L.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Disappointed not just in the mouth, but on the tongue too. Dry finish üçí. Very enjoyable! Up .25 yet again. üíï BBC üíï",

  "Serious stuff! Canned yesterday. A little thin, but very good.",
  "This is very good, yummy!",

  "Very frothy, quite dry. Fruit does get more serious as it warms up. Quite pinky-ish. 4.3 Merci Vincent L.",
  "Obviously delicate, delicate. Dry finish. Sabro is present but subtle. Nice.",
  "Serious stuff! Foam is all I'm really tasting, and it‚Äôs getting pretty good. Oats really give it a distinctive mouthfeel. Merci Matthieu L. Giant Peach üíï Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Pretty sour, quite bretty. Nice bitterness. Another good one from SPBW.",
  "They threw chocolate, coconut macaroons, ice cream and good coffee in the blender, right? Pretty sure I would drink a lot of this.",
  "Could be thicker, but still delicious. Rather old school, garage door feel. Fresh can.",
  "Where's the smoothness? Boozy, quite dry, not overly sweet. Very nice!",
  "Spread the milk rather well. Nice texture. Citrusy and a little bitter for a non-nano PA. Wouldn't hesitate to split a whole bottle in half! 4.35",
  "Love that nose. Fruity, but I'm a bit short on mouthfeel.",
  "Really nice texture. Peachy, but also boozy. Pretty good. 4.15.",
  "Bold, bitter, old-school, but still grapefruity, very well made. This is a good little saison, a little old-school, and well made. 4.12",
  "Very good IPA.",
  "Very sour from the DIPA. Not bad, but Somewhat old school. 4.12.",
  "Meh... lousy sours! Sour is too crude for my liking. Boozy again tonight!  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Bottle this time. It's a fruity JK. Well, about 4.5.",
  "Light, fluffy, simple. Love it. Great new small bottle.",
  "Very frothy nose. Taste its bitterness taken with some caution. If you don't mind, it‚Äôs a splendid summer beer üòé. 4.12/5",
  "Citra and Simcoe, tropical, dank, sharp, has more bite than #GiT. Merci Renaud B. et Vincent L.",
  "Nice mouthfeel, almond, jam. Slightly astringent. Very well done.",
  "Finally, a good IPA to compare it to. Maybe my tastes are different, but still an ok stout.",
  "Powerful. Great mouthfeel. Not a style I know, but this is the thing: most people don't notice or taste the difference.  3.9",
  "Beautiful dark pinkish colour. Rather old school, piney, bitter and frothy (it gets smoothed out in the mouth). Nice finish.",
  "This is delicious! Thought it was the raspberry/peach version, but no, just the regular one (my 1st one). Amazing nose, really! Up .25",
  "Very malty, quite bitter, very uninteresting in the mouth. Nothing to do with beer...",
  "Thin, thin, not odd, but still decent.",
  "The best Hypas I've tasted so far in CA. Up .25",

  "The best Stray Dog I've had so far in 2015.",

  "Gusher... refreshing and dryish, but I can barely taste the barrel. A little sweet. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb üòú",
  "Not bad, otherwise, great. Best NEIPA I've had.",
  "Mmmmhhhhhh!!! The definition of balance. Good mouthfeel, juicy, Peach, tropical. And I have 2 more bottles üòé",
  "Surprisingly thin for ABV (10.3%). Dark chocolate comes forward, hazelnut & bourbon are more discrete. Good, though a tad thin for a pale ale.",
  "Very good texture and bourbon barrel, pretty enjoyable. One of the best sours I've had.",
  "Dry, bitter, piney, citrusy, quite tropical and quite boozy, pretty frothy (around + lactose). On the nose, more carbonation than expected, more hop bite than it shows on the palate. Nice Bourbon nose. Notes of green tea. Intense. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "More NEIPA than Sabro, more than a little boozy. Love the dude!",
  "Coffee, sour, bitter, rather typical BBC, vinous but not vinous, even licorice. It's good, not the most boring NEIPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Beautiful dark yellow haze. Rather old school, piney, bitter and dusty. Pretty stale. 3.85/5",
  "So fruity I forget. Nice sour, not too sour. Guests forgot to take it back!",

  "As good as expected from Dominion. Thick, dank, juicy, tropical. The hype is real. #THrules",

  "Very nice on the nose. Fruit 'n funk. Floral, funky (hopefully). Quite pleasant. Expected more from Bellwoods...",
  "Not great, but very nice.",
  "Surprisingly thin. Thin, not as rich as I expected, maybe a tad too sweet, which is not a big kick to any ale I've tried yet. Pretty good.",
  "Very nice mouthfeel, boozy. Quite pleasant when fresh. Fresh can is even better! Merci Simon L. , Rest In Peace.",

  "OK little old-school IPA, little West Coast IPA. Not much to it.",
  "A little old school, but that salt does give it a distinctive taste.",
  "Fruit juice with slight hop burn. Interesting, but I prefer my IPAs not sour. Hoppy! Decent mouthfeel. Average too. 4.65 Merci beaucoup Matthieu L. , pas d√©√ßu!",

  "Coffee, bourbon, vanilla, tropical. Very nice!",
  "A little sickly sweet, too much dulce + spicy scotch bonnet  üå∂ = AFAIK, one of the best gueuzes in Ontario. Kicks ass! Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "A little harsh, but good mouthfeel.",
  "Nice texture, nice bourbon barrel, not overly boozy, smooth.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Collab with Bar Lupulus. Great NEIPA, smooth with just enough sugar to be pleasantly surprised. Luscious mouthfeel, dank, citrusy, tropical.",
  "Nice mouthfeel, tropical. Not sure if I'm buying this fresh or just in my tap water, really smooth. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Decent mouthfeel. Sweet, but not too sweet or bitter. Goes well with St-Guillaume-type fresh cheddar. 4.4.",
  "Thought the canned version was better. I'm pleasantly surprised. Rich coffee and good whiskey nose. Well balanced. 4.15",

  "You know, for BTP, the maybe the best sour beer I've had so far in CA. And it's got a good mouthfeel. BBC üôÑ Oh, don't worry, I had a treat...",
  "Surprisingly smooth. Nice coffee and very decent bourbon presence. Nice but a little thin. Merci Matthieu L. et... Renaud?",
  "Surprisingly nice hop bill, very refreshing in the hot sun. Low carbonation, malt and fruit. Good texture. This is an IPA, not an IPA. 4.15",
  "Nice mouthfeel, tropical. Really not bad, if not the most complex IPA out there. Oak is very present. Was an earlier batch, but I'm spoiled when I'm Not. üíï",
  "A little old school. Nothing particularly stands out. Good coffee and chocolate presence, though not as much as was hoped for. 4.10 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "The most intense lager I've had from Abner. I think they overdid it. Too sweet, but that's what counts. 3.9",
  "Not very fizzy, rather complex.  3.9",
  "A little sickly sweet, too much dulce + spicy scotch bonnet  üå∂ = Too much DIPA, not enough smoke , underwhelming at first but can definitely taste the piney side. Bravo DIPA!",
  "The best PA I've ever tasted, the genuine Ontario way. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Low-key bitter, not overly complex. Lacks mouthfeel, but otherwise great. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Fruity-ass green üçá, vinous, nice bourbon presence, not too dry. Strawberry is just present, not too uninteresting.",
  "Really nice texture, very refreshing, but lacks substance. Nice to drink a little old-school.",
  "Luscious mouthfeel, lovely bourbon kick, chocolate. Really hits the spot tonight! Simon L. & Vincent L. gooooood!",
  "Downgrading it. Maybe my tastes are changing because of all the great hoppy options we have nowadays, but the one I'm used to is not as enticing or enjoyable as it used to be.",

  "Serious DIPA, interesting as usual. I kind of smell like vinegar, though. Nice nose. Refreshing. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Dry this time. Less harsh, a bit harsher, more hop burn, original, oaky. Good texture. Similar to P√©ch√© mortel. 4.15",

  "This is the best NEIPA I've had, quality could not be worse!!! Merci Matthieu L.",

  "Wow! Love it! Umpteenth time in a can, so fresh, I can taste the cinnamon sugar, but still something is missing. Love it!",
  "Odd coffee and vanilla taste, but not quite as much as I remember. Good texture.  3.9",
  "How can you go wrong with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy? The usual BBC class, melon, tropical fruit and an amazing mouthfeel. A great nightcap if you want to shine...",
  "Nice texture and bourbon barrel, pretty drinkable. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Hard to resist when visiting. Love it still so much!",
  "Good mouthfeel, slightly boozy, coffee is somewhat subtle. Good NEIPA.",
  "The best Hypas I've had so far in CA. Nice hops, Mosaic and nice funk. Very good, I could drink a lot of this.",
  "Coffee is good and rich. Thin, 3.85.",
  "As good as expected from Dominion. The wood is nice, the rich coffee. Crisp and dry. 4.35",
  "I think this is the best single NEIPA in a long time. Strange brew üí• coming from a pils.",
  "Surprisingly thin for this price. Slight oak, and that's about it. Merci Patrick C.",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy. Bretty and winey. Pretty bitter, though. Dry finish. Could be sweeter. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Serious Gin and Mosaic, definitely has the BBC DNA. Nice surprise, even if some (partly)  BBC taste.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Simple scotch nose. Fruit and citrus. Quite nice. 4.15",
  "Coffee and chocolate. Quite malty. üòã",
  "Nose is all chocolate. In the mouth, it's a berry üçí nose. Less creamy than expected, but Beautiful again...",
  "I think the oatmeal comes through more than in the mouth. Nice coffee and very pleasant smell. Very well done.",
  "Sure bet. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Could have a couple more. Not boozy, very hoppy. Merci Matthieu L. et... Renaud?",
  "Old school... and ugly! Coffee, cocoa, vanilla, chocolate, but above all: rum.",
  "Very nice, good mouthfeel, slight sting, you'd be lucky to find this in a bar...  Nothing to write home about!",
  "Rich chocolate, bitter right out of Pulp Fiction, followed by a fruity and yummy üçí you bet! What a great start!",
  "Good mouthfeel, typical of BBC. Refreshing, you wouldn't want an IPA on tap. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Honest stout. Carbonation too, maybe too green for my 1st tick. Pleasant. Mouthfeel OK, but 4.25 is too much. Ok to revisit. 3.9",
  "On the sweet side. Very tropical and aptly named. This is my 1st glass. So far, I can taste the pineapple and mango. Another great local option. 4.35",
  "Greenish, bitter, lumpy, not very dry, finish with üçí. Single hop. Almost 4.5. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "A little crude, but quite nice.",
  "Dat peach jam, nothing more. Dank AF, awesome texture, almost 4.25. Merci Patrick C.",
  "I think they lowered the bar here a notch. Delicate yet melon, decent amount of bite. 4.25",
  "Traditional, old-school, not much to it. I mean, it's a pils... Matthieu L.",
  "Rich coffee, some bitterness, good mouthfeel. Not old school but interesting.",
  "Wow! Pleasant summer treat! Not the most complex PA out there, but it doesn't have to be. Somewhat thin or bland.",
  "Thinner than I remember. Nice Bourbon nose. There is a little more to it than that. Not familiar with this style. Vaguely reminds me of Le Cheval blanc in the late 80's (VT does have a signature hazy beer on tap).) 3.85",
  "In the can, but it's too green for my liking. Going up .25",
  "Grape, not too sweet or dry, very well balanced. Another great one from SPBW.",
  "Just a... survival tick, nothing stands out. Pretty sure I'll have more if I have. Honest coffee, good bitterness, not overly sweet. OK rating.",
  "Sugar plum ü••. Bretty, woody and fairly dry. Pretty nice. Love that shit!  BBC are well-liked and enjoyed by a great many. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "What a sight! This is the best PA I‚Äôve had ever! Merci Simon L. , pas d√©√ßu! Merci Matthieu L. et Vincent L.",
  "Low acidity, a bit of citra, good mouthfeel. Hoppy because of the low acidity. Underrated. üíï",
  "Downgrading it. Probably had better sessions. Meh.... big coffee nose. Less flat and drinkable.",
  "Really nice texture, good hop burn, but upping it a notch, at a time.",
  "A little hazy, a little flat, I can‚Äôt tell apples are any closer to 5% ABV.",
  "Very good, price is great, nice coffee and rum rum, just the right acidity. Not too boozy. Worth 2...",
  "Good mouthfeel, nice bourbon and vanilla balance, good coffee and raspberry balance. Not too shabby! 4.35",

  "Heineken DNA, faint Pilsner presence, but a bit too sour. It works.",

  "Nice mouthfeel, delicate with medium tartness. Solid.",
  "Simple, light, barely sour. Very pleasant.",
  "Luscious mouthfeel, sweet, boozy, nice DDH kick, a very lucky brewery. üíïüíïüíï",
  "Nice mouthfeel, almond, jam. Sweet but balanced by some bitterness. Quite nice. 4.1",
  "Batch #5, still awesome, though a little thin this time. Looking forward to the next one!",
  "Very frothy, not a West Coast IPA, but not as rich as expected from Dominion. Medium tartness. Tastes a little wild, but that's not the point. 3.6",
  "Not that bad, maybe not to be tasted, but not much aftertaste.",
  "I'm pleasantly surprised, not that surprised in a bottle. Fruity, fruity, a little destabilizing...",
  "8%??? But still not bad. And I can tell your identity, for sure. Belgo thank you very much. üíï",
  "Simple... but nice. Nice oak bite. Mouthfeel OK. 3.85 Merci Vincent L. Matthieu L.",
  "Pretty traditional DIPA, quite malty and bitter.",

  "Thin, dank, tropical hazy. Not heavy on bite. Tasty. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Hard to resist when visiting. Oh! How lovely it is to taste old school. üíï",

  "Funky nose. Medium tartness. Nice.",
  "Very good texture, nice tingling on the tongue, another great IPA from Small Pony. So well done!",
  "Harsh. Lots of sourness, including a dash of burnt sugar. It tastes like candy...",
  "This is a bitter DIPA, not a... Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Good coffee and quite malty, dry mouthfeel. Not a style I'm familiar with, never had one before. Nice texture. Ok, 3.87",

  "Very good!!! PB berry and light funk. Pretty good.",

  "Medium old school IPA.",
  "Looks and sounds like a no name beer, but it ain't. üíï",
  "Ok dry, slight oak and fruit that is mellowed by the grain. Nicely done.",
  "Not too bad, thinnish, not that bad. I have 2 more to double brew.",
  "Serious DIPA, interesting but old school. 3.85",
  "Nose is a little thin. Coffee is very discrete. Nice surprise, best SS ever! ‚ù§Ô∏è Merci Simon L.",
  "Great mouthfeel, juicy, typical Dominion IPA, in a thicker, richer version. Not quite as strong as expected. 4.2",
  "Good mouthfeel, boozy, grassy. Good balance. 4.15",
  "Really not bad, but a little thin, man!",
  "Thin, coarse, just sweet enough, but thin.",
  "Another amazing one from the kings! Pleasant and refreshing. Tasty. Merci Matthieu L. (better English than IPA)!",
  "They call Lupulus a porter, not a stout. Not true. Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "Disappointing, maybe a little harsh, Western-leaning but still something that I'll have to get used to.  Delicious bourbon aftertaste.",
  "Fruit, tart, nice citrus, tickles tongue. Good texture. 4.12, + üçç, üçé and oaky apple below. Dry finish. Very well done!  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Once you get over that intense bitterness, it‚Äôs a very satisfying smoke. This is refined die Hard IPA, not a PA. Very good mouthfeel.",
  "Not very complex, but well made and tasty. 3.6",
  "Matured almost 2 weeks ago, so not sure if it's meant to be like this. Decent Citra, you üò∂!",
  "Look even better than last year. Tropical, juicy, with a delicate touch of vanilla. üíïüíï",

  "Not very elaborate, but well made. Similar to some of their other great stouts. 4.15",

  "üçí üçí üçí üçí üç∑ üç∑. Not too sour, funk, oak. Very nice. üíï",
  "Doing quality I‚Äôve never tasted before. Mouthfeel of a pack Call me a Pils!",
  "Could actually be green.",
  "Honest stout, malty, boozy, nice saison. God bless BBC. So creamy!",
  "Fresh can. Old school as expected.  Ginger, cinnamon, vanilla and... something else? Sticking to 4. Old school.",
  "Maybe the most underrated sour in Quebec.",

  "11.5%...",
  "Gorgeous orange and balsamic vinegar. Quite nice, but a little thin. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Mmmhhh! This is like going back to when I discovered HF (Abner & Harlan) and Sip of Sunshine. Again, that \"pioneer\" feel, like a piece of history.",
  "Mmmmhhhhhh!!! Me gusta ron!!! Good mouthfeel, moderate hop burn, raisin, fig, molasses, but above all: rum.",
  "Doing a double take today. One of the best Bellwoods IPAs around. Slightly hoppy, very tropical.",

  "Meh...  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Much smoother than I recall. A great NEIPA, much harsher than expected. Merci Patrick C.",

  "I say repeat NOT after first thought. Boozy!!!",
  "Very malty, a bit of raspberry, decent mouthfeel. Easy drinking, thanks Tyson S. Tyson S. 4.13",
  "Looks and sounds like a no name, but it ain't. No mouthfeel, barely taste like... something... unusual or old school. Reminds me of Nickel Brook's Headstock, only a tad better.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Easily one of the best Hypas.  Merci Simon L.",
  "Hard to resist when visiting Belgium. Love it even more than before. Very jammy, just the perfect sourness. My fave from Small Pony. ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è",
  "You wouldn't know it's a collab w BBC. Typical Dominion sour, typical Dominion dank ahead... Dominion's not done yet, they say.",
  "Coffee and chocolate. Quite tropical. More sour than Bourbon. Very nice.",

  "Not as sweet as I remember, really. Intense.",
  "Nice coffee and vanilla tone, very well balanced. Merci Simon L. & Vincent L.",
  "A little sickly sweet, too much dulce + spicy scotch bonnet  üå∂ = Almost plasticky at 1st. My least fave so far from HF.",
  "Very frothy, must contain Dark Chocolate and Wine. Frothy AF!",
  "Light, fluffy, a tad sour, should be on the sweet side. Gets better as it warms up.",
  "Flat and rather thin, but not as much as I remember.",
  "Grossly underrated. The best IPA in Ottawa from one of the best to few, what a gift! As much as I love this small can, it's such a welcome change from Vox Pop Galaxy. 4.6 üíï Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Just 4.25, which is a low rating given the style. Good hops, but very little mouthfeel. Merci Matthieu L. and Tyson S.",
  "Not bad, but Somewhat watery. I was expecting more jam. Would be awesome on a hot summer day. 3.85",
  "Luscious mouthfeel, lovely bourbon kick, chocolate. Really hits the spot tonight! Simon L. & Vincent L. soient lou√©s, meubl√©s ou non, frigid 1st üëçüèº",
  "Scrumptious Bourbon nose, but low acidity. Sweet but not boozy. Good mouthfeel. Good DIPA.",
  "I think this is the best Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "Pleasantly surprised, better than Moutere.",
  "Oh! This is good! Batch is so good, soapy, kind of like sours. Grapefruit and orange points. Nice balance. 4.35",
  "Gee-whizz! Excellent mouthfeel, tropical, all right, I should have had it before Lollipop... but still, something's wrong. Maybe it should have been on shelves at all. Merci Matthieu L. et Antoine C.",
  "Oh, this is a great one!",
  "Worth screwing up with the imperial....",
  "Well, Stray Dog isn't my fave...",
  "How can you go wrong with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy? The usual BBC class, delicate wine, good acidity and finish, one of year. On the nose, just amazing! )",
  "Nice mouthfeel, tropical. Not too shabby from Abner. 4.12/5",
  "Pleasantly surprised, better than most IPA du Nord-est offerings. Tropical, well balanced. Merci S√©bastien B. Matthieu L.",
  "Just an awesome Hypa, great mouthfeel, tropical. And love the TIPA. So well done!",
  "Not at BBC or Brewskey level, not bad, but a little harsh. I was expecting something more along the lines of BBC or Ottawa.",
  "How can you go wrong with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy? The usual BBC class, melon, tropical fruit and an amazing mouthfeel. A great APA üí©",
  "It‚Äôs boozy, but that‚Äôs to be expected from an amber ale. Downgrading it. Still cool for a DIPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very nice for a West-Coast IPA, √† la West Coast, in a Western-leaning state. Not that boozy for 11.9% ABV! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Hard to resist when visiting. Love it even more than before, the vanilla makes it feel more natural. Delish.",
  "Simple English-type stout, quite boozy. Nice caramel and chocolate notes, kind of old school. 4.12.",
  "Now at Port, go!!!",
  "I need to fix this oatmeal thing...",
  "Maybe not the most unique beer, but still quite simple. It works.",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. The mouthfeel is there, although faint. It's true...",
  "Not super complex, but well made and tasty. More tea than pie base, super berry.",
  "Nice coriander nose. Not very complex, but satisfying.",
  "Never tasted before. Pleasant, sweet and traditional. Almost 4.",
  "I need this more than ever. The potential here is definitely there.",
  "Not great, but not as bad as expected. Good balance, I ‚ù§Ô∏è it.",

  "Simple and delicious. Fruity. Decent.",
  "Why? Because it's yummy!",
  "Exceptional nose. Tropical, lovely peach and passion fruit. Easy drinking, thanks Tyson S.",
  "Good mouthfeel, as usual for Badlands. Peach, jam, tropics. 4.65 Merci S√©bastien B.",
  "Subtle mosaic taste, wish it were more present, but nice nonetheless. No small Simon!",
  "Odd coffee and vanilla taste, but not very sweet. Reminds me of Passion Fruit. Unmistakably, it's Pulp Fiction!",
  "Very creamy: lemon, chocolate, bourbon. Not very creamy on the nose, but rather means green. Quite pleasant. A great DIPA over coffee.",
  "Surprisingly tasty, not as enticing as other Auval iterations. Nice bitterness. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Dry, bitter, apple, not quite sweet enough. Still very drinkable, yet affordable. Merci Vincent L.",
  "Greenish, bitter, piney, pointing to its malt. Not too shabby! 3.9",
  "Not bad, but Somewhat crude. I don't get the sour fruit. Could be a tad less sweet. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Good texture, sweet and boozy, vanilla is discrete... quite malty... very well balanced. üíïüíïüíï",
  "Fruity-wise, tasty but not as much as other Trilliums I've tried. Good balance right? Merci P√©ch√© Matthieu L.",
  "Quite boozy nose, not that berry. Rather delicate, but still very fruity. This is very good üòä",

  "Oh! This is so good, so smooth, so amazing, I can barely taste the coconut! And I'm a lightweight, thank God!",
  "Apple candy, not too bitter, just sweet enough, but also boozy, crying in the summer.",
  "It's got that old-school taste. West Coast, it should be. Creamy, quite dry, not  overly complex. 3.65",
  "Wonderful nose. Hazy and very coffee. A little astringent. But of little note. Ok.",
  "Good texture, nice bourbon and vanilla balance, not too malty. Was going to give 3.75, but ok for 4.",
  "Luscious mouthfeel, lovely bourbon kick, chocolate. Really hits the spot tonight! Going up .25",
  "Nice mouthfeel, ruby and green apple, somewhat bitter, not too sweet, fairly balanced. A great DIPA pointing westward. Thanks Tyson S. Matthieu L.",
  "OS AF but not boozy either. Still good. mellow, good mouthfeel.",
  "Really nice texture. Peachy, but also boozy, because peach is very forward.  3.9",
  "This JK doesn't taste like lambic acidity. Very nice!",
  "Now you're talking. Great mouthfeel, just the right bitterness and hop burn, and in a good way, quality French-style.",
  "Woody, refreshing, not too bitter, trace of lemon, fairly carbonated. Probably helps that it doesn't have a name...",
  "This shit is lovely, the dry hop comes forward in the mouth too. The dryness is nice, the malt is very present, the weak hop bite is there, the dryness is nice. 4.1",
  "Now on tap. Really dig this one. Medium barrel, really good bourbon taste. Perfect balance. Rating is bang on. 4.35. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Beets? I thought it was in the can, not sure if it's still in the can because it was fresh when I pulled the bottle out. Was expecting more!",
  "Very good nose. Raspberry notes present, sweet but not too much, smooth. Pretty good. Pretty decent. One of the best Raspberry Messorem.",
  "Tart yet delicate. Lovely finish. Great BBC üçí!",
  "Consistent with others from the same series (my fave from Collective Arts), maybe a tad better. Merci Matthieu L.",

  "Very mild, just bitter enough.",
  "I love this sour DIPA. It's got a very nice note to it. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Still pretty nice, from what I can tell, from the guys, very decent beer.",
  "You wouldn't know it's a collab with such a name, yet I",
  "Apple seems to enhance the smoke. Good balance, that's for sure.",
  "Hazy, almost hibiscus, but more like a session. Not exactly like what I'm drinking it on tap. Mouthfeel OK, but I'd take a liter instead of 1000s. Merci Matthieu L. & Vincent L.",
  "It smells a little (too) like root beer. Good IPA, but \"impeccably done\" is its Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "I liked them better when I used to buy Nabob. Same with Sip of Sunshine. Maybe I‚Äôve gotten over myself sometimes. Gin and blackberry make a pretty nice pairing. 3.6",
  "The fruit is tasty and I like how it tastes sweeter. Citrusy and a little metallic for me, but still a great APA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Oh, crap! Best Stray Dog I've had so far. So very good, taste is delicious, not exactly sweet, but still not a bad value for money. 4.4",
  "More sour than expected but with a very nice fruity side (cherries). Nice.",

  "Very sour, very piney. Quite nice. Again, bless BBC!",
  "Still my fave from HF, such a nice change! 4.4/5",
  "Not very salty or sour, rather party type dankness. Not too shabby either.",

  "Very good coffee, just bitter enough, pretty damned close. Very decent Guinness.",
  "It's a porter, not a stout. Rather light, not overly sweet or boozy. You know what? It works.",
  "Very good mouthfeel, as usual for Badlands. This one‚Äôs a little green.",
  "Like a double Sunsplit; in a Pepsi challenge, I'd bet it's from Dominion (where I live) who said the match is\"! This is very decent stout, not too shabby! 4.35",
  "Sweet, fruity, somewhat hazy, very refreshing. Almost a pale ale. I can live with it. Nice balance, on the delicate side.",
  "Nice funk, almond, tropical. Not bitter, just bitter enough. Very nice, I would drink it again and again. Great saison!",
  "Pleasantly surprised! Liquorice!!! Very sweet, but it ain't cheap. Canned June 6.",
  "Very light and almost no funk. One of my fave Bellwoods IPAs. Quite nice!",
  "Pleasantly surprised! Melon, banana, chocolate, nicely balanced. What a surprise! Creamy and surprisingly sour for a pale ale. Almost NEIPA. Good!",
  "Finally! Well, 2015... Not quite... still a success, but impressive for a single-hop brew. Certainly not as good as Solstice. Disappointed üíï",
  "Wow!!! Don't miss it!",
  "Wow! Love it! So smooth. The vanilla is very present, but not too strong. Oh! This is so good! And I can taste the peach pit! Peach! Apricot pits very come true! üíïüíïüíï",
  "Good coffee, just the right acidity and bitterness and just the right amount of dust. From the brewery...",

  "Now you're talking! Great mouthfeel, better than Dinkel.",
  "Very good quality Pale ale base, bb, but not overly bitter.",
  "That skunky coffee taste, boozy, but better than Bas-Canada's La Torre. Pretty vanilla, oatmeal, no cacao, very malty. Usual thinness, though. 4.1 Merci Vincent L.",
  "Not a style I'm really used to. It's got that coarse East-Coast nose, but a trace of hops. Nice hops.",
  "Almost a month old but you wouldn't know it. Quite sweet (Citra and Mosaic), balanced by a fair bit of vanilla (a little much?). Thinnish, yet enjoyable. 3.6",
  "Not very fizzy, not very rich or sour, it doesn't really have a name yet. A DIPA.",
  "I think this time, BTP (and maybe A&G)... it ain't.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Rather bretty, probably more Stray Dog than I remember. Oh well, at least I had a good batch. 4.15",
  "A little frothy, not a style I'm familiar with before SPBW. Nice tartness, not too sweet or dry, kind of like a scotch ale. Slightly boozy. 4.15",
  "A little too frothy. Really not that bad.",
  "Not bad for a 5.2% ABV. Wintery.",
  "Wow! üçí pie! Really fruity, a little spicy as well (cinnamon) and nice carbonation too. Really good.",
  "Not that different from regular JK. Very dry, quite dry, not sweet enough (cinnamon). Quite nice.",
  "Not very hoppy, but quite nice. Slightly oaky, clean. Yummy! Merci Renaud B.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot!üòú",
  "This is a fine NEIPA, very delicate and delicate... or very delicate... cognac... We're pleasantly surprised in Ottawa.",
  "Uncharacteristically mild for these islands. Rather bitter, something's missing. Whatever it is, it works.",
  "Very nice mouthfeel. Sweet, fragrant. Very decent NEIPA.",
  "Dense, intense, creamy, quite frothy, slightly sour, well balanced. Tropical value here. Interesting. üòã",
  "A little raw, a little bitter, probably from the hops, maybe a little resinous too. Ceci... Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Look old by day, but pretty decent at night. Honest coffee and bourbon. Good texture.",
  "Just awesome. As in, over the top. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Again, the tamest Hypa. No need to go all the way to Massachusetts, though. Honest oats, chocolate and coffee. Well balanced. 3.6",
  "Their most recent üçí, BTP's not bad, just not as nice as the first batch. Still 8.5%, but a tad thin... 4.15",
  "Good mouthfeel, sourness confined to a certain barrel. This is a good pils, very close to perfection.",
  "I think this time, BTP's pretty much nailed it. Up .25.",
  "Basically a Galaxy back (wonder fruit back, BTP is one of their best) but this is better, sweeter and has a little more üçá in it. 3.6",
  "TGIF***ing great beer nightcap-wise. Heavy on hop bite (Citra-L) but not overbearing (Citra)",
  "Could be dryer, but still a very good APA. Merci Antoine C.",
  "raspberry dominant, lime dominant. Pretty solid.",
  "So subtle. Quite bitter, but other than that, it tastes like a boozy porter. I wouldn't drink a can that way. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very dry. Old school, mostly. Dry hop burn. No mouthfeel. Almost a dessert, but not quite as good as most. 4.15. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Not sweet enough... Not much bitterness, but a little too malty for me. Ok, thinnish for me. 3.9.. Thanks Tyson S. Matthieu L.",
  "Really nice texture, very decent alcohol presence, reminds me of some of Dominion City. Peachy.",
  "Just what a wild NEIPA feels like. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Once had it on tap for so long. Great bourbon base, sweet but not overly sweet or dry, just the right funk. Mouthfeel OK. 4.35, solid.",
  "Raspberry dominant, orange and (more often) white. Beautiful color and complex fruity taste. Amazing for a first raspberry.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Oh yeah! HAPPY NEW YEAR! From the great Aussie Aussie to the Old West, here it is, totally awesome! The definition of balance. As always, great local ingredients ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è",
  "Not too bad, thinnish, not much taste, but pretty typical Dominion IPA.",
  "Fruit, tart, lovely; I taste citra, but other than that, lovely.",
  "Not too bad, thinnish, not that fresh, but it's still a decent saison.",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice coffee and vanilla pairing, but it didn't come through very well. Kind of old school, anyway. 4.15",
  "Quite fruity, evanescent of oak. Rather bitter. Very nice, I could drink a lot. Ok, maybe not as awesome as last year, but still a great APA.",
  "I liked this one quite a bit more than the previous batch. , , , a little weak , but still  exactly what I need. East meets West .  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Finally! Tropical storm! Bring it!",
  "Seems to a little rhubarb...",
  "Coffee and chocolate. Quite tropical. Again, the üçí! A bit thin, but very good IMO. 3.9/5. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "First time in a can. One of my fave Bellwoods IPAs. Dank, not overly sweet or tropical (i.e. Nelson Sauvin & Citra), tropical fruit and really hits the spot on the balance of hop and carbonation. 4.35",
  "Simply malty, quite malty, a little hoppy. Well, 75% BBA üòã Merci Matthieu L.",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad. But what I'm saying: this is like scotch ale without the big guns. üíï",
  "About a year later, same rating. Really not that great.",
  "Not bad, better than the big bottle from the same series. Fresh can. Discreet Bourbon. 4.12 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Fruit, tart, not too bad, I don't taste peach much.",
  "Really nice intro, then some more watery. Very refreshing, easy drinking, almost 4.",
  "Woah, I'm a üçí kind of guy, and this fits the bill. Pleasant surprise in the nose, chocolate and vanilla. Interesting.",
  "Gusher... interesting + spicy batch. Ok for summer.",
  "Very nice, good mouthfeel, slightly tart, dank, tropical. Pretty good.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic! Very nice! üíïüíïüíï",

  "Waiting in the cold to load up on great releases for BBC's 2nd anniversary. These guys are fucking awesome!",
  "I love that fruit.",
  "Really good texture, but I like it more jammy. Nice.",
  "OS AF but pretty damned good.",
  "Not too sweet, not too thin.",
  "Arguably their best iteration. Tropical, well-balanced, juicy gooseberry, medium tartness. 4.4/5 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Rather rich, less hop bite than usual Strong aroma of Portland. No need to be a beer lover to love it.",
  "Chocolate and coffee, mama! Fruity! Tropical, hazy, oaky! 4.6, good üòä",
  "Traditional, old-school, too bitter and taffy for me. But tasty, I like it stronger than most. 4.15",
  "It's got the Bellwoods nose, but a more hibiscus and more woody. Nice mouthfeel.",
  "üçí, almond, chamomile. Pretty sour, but not overbearing. Underrated. 3.6",
  "Surprisingly thin, not boozy, pretty disappointing.",
  "Very interesting type of sour, berry. Rather harsh, yet refreshing. Reminds me of Founders KBS, maybe a tad less sweet I don't know. A great DIPA, not the most extravagant, but still an excellent old-school DIPA.",
  "Very good NEIPA, very light, tropical. Well made.",
  "Rather crisp, not too complex or dry. This is now about 2.5 weeks old, and it's definitely smoother. Now, people are talking, I should have waited a day to celebrate th... more...",
  "Rather funky, better mouthfeel than Grand Cru, which is nice in a (good) IPA. A little thin, but still a solid basic hoppy.",
  "Now on tap. Slight resin. Dry, slight leather, coffee and vanilla, trace of earth or dust. Amazing! üçí",
  "Wow! Love it! So smooth. Taste is very interesting. Simple, yet delicious. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I feel I got... something  missing. If you look close, you can tell it's a berry PM. Did I mention DDH? üçç",
  "Very sour, very piney. Pretty good, not overly sweet, either. 4.12.",
  "Dank and fruity. Nice hop burn. Fresh can.",
  "Nose is all coffee. In the mouth, coffee balances. In the mouth, yummy üòã but so sweet, tastes a little like sugar. Good mouthfeel, not Bas-Canada's best.",
  "Basic pale ale, very faint... quite malty, a little hoppy, but not overly sweet. Rivals all but the best DIPAs. 4.12/5",
  "Very fruity, a little more sour than other lambics I've tried, 4.4",
  "A little crude, but good hop burn and mouthfeel. Nice balance. 4.15",
  "Hoppy, fruity and slightly sour, reminds me of .... Tastes a little bit like chocolate, but with less bitterness and vanilla. Good value for $      Merci Matthieu L.",
  "smells like panettone üòúMassive pils! Quite good, great nose, tropical. Amazing coffee and chocolate burn , dank, tonka bean and roasted 1-hop. üíïüíï Merci beaucoup Matthieu L.",
  "Maybe I'm stepping too far from this great non-NEDIPA stash, but this really isn't too bad.",
  "Some serious brew, with a nice grape aftertaste. Could have more sour notes. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Upping it a notch, it has more bite than it did. Getting better as time went on. Still a very tasty wild ale. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Almost a sip old school at first, but then gets very, very nice (plum) üíï",
  "Intense coconut nose follows on the palate. Trace of bitter chocolate. Very thin. Malt, chocolate and bourbon. Quite sweet. Very disappointing. 4.12",
  "Rather acidic and old school, more julep than beer. Not much mouthfeel. Slightly raw. Mouthfeel OK. 3.85. Merci Vincent L.",
  "Not very fizzy, rather complex, funk, apple. Quite nice. Refreshing.",
  "Nice citrus, pleasant bourbon and vanilla finish, not too dry, slightly taffy, easy peasy.",
  "Much better than I remember on this old Mixtape. Frothy AF! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "off-putting acidic finish, but nice funk. Could be a tad more sour, but I wouldn't drink this in a small can.",
  "Surprisingly dry, if you don't mind the Belgian type.",
  "Rather than buying this in small batches, I'm surprised. Strange...",
  "Just dessert üòã 4.15 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very malty, a bit of wood, good hop burn and dryness. Quite nice! 4.35",
  "Pure chocolate. Very nice, but not my fave from Small Pony. 10% ABV...  Would have bought more! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad! 4.6",
  "I love this sour IPA. Tropical. Well balanced. üçí and üçí maybe less rounded, but still a great option for a late night sip. 4.15",
  "Huge chardonnay nose. Fruity. Good acidity. Mouthfeel OK for a Monday night. OK mouthfeel, but I expected more.",
  "Canned 1 month ago, so it could be fresher. Still very nice, if somewhat hoppy. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Dry, bitter, old school, but still 4.5.",
  "Batch this thin... it tasted like three months old, and oh well. Comfort, light, and dank. 4.12/5",
  "Great mouthfeel, flowery, but more like a session? Well, I (almost) love the session version, even better than the previous one. Splendid üëç",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad! Merci Simon L.",
  "Harsh. Very dry. Some dank, some sweet. For a pale ale, it's surprisingly crisp. Merci Patrick C.",
  "You wouldn't know it's a pils (it's a pils), the bourbon, the coffee, the delicate yet delicate yet very well made cheese. And again, the üçí and the üçØ...",
  "Very tame üçí, mellow, good mouthfeel. Love it.",
  "Nice bourbon and coffee touch, good texture, but as is often the case, the milk sugar makes it taste a little like aspartame. OK.",
  "Canned June 6, 2018. Still pretty fucking good.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "That time of the year.... Reminds me of this year. So sickeningly sweet!",
  "Very nice bourbon base, chocolate. Lovely üòä",
  "Very good mouthfeel, blueberry with significant fruity aftertaste. Nice.",
  "A little old school. Nothing particularly stands out. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "It's a porter, not a stout, and I wouldn't drink one if only trying it on tap. Honest coffee and chocolate. Good balance. 4.15",
  "You know, for the price (a",
  "Too sour and fruity for me, I prefer... I don't like it. It's weak but it's still tart and yummy. I love it üòç",
  "Same old same old, again different watery taste. Very disappointing. Same rating.",
  "I wish I had had the bottle. I'm spoiled with so-called NEIPAs, ones that are actually better than they are. This just isn't what I was looking for. 3.9",
  "Good mouthfeel, slightly boozy, coffee is quite nice. 4.38/5",
  "Low acidity and sourness, mostly, like a well-balanced stout, but delicate and bitter on the nose. Delish.",
  "Dry, bitter, old school, but still grapefruity and malty. Like a weak Hypa. 3.85",
  "You wouldn't know it's a collab w BBC ü§ò. So yummy!",
  "Fruity-ass lime, good mouthfeel, not that berry, but still a decent mouthfeel. I could drink a lot of this...",
  "Watered apple juice... somewhat acidic, too much hop bite. Pretty green nonetheless. BBC...",
  "You can't get more cereal than this. Amazing mouthfeel, heavenly coconut and coffee balance, hazelnut and bourbon in a safe, pale ale.",
  "Smells like dessert üòúMassive  chocolate attack. Very good mouthfeel. Pretty solid. Guinness is surprisingly low quality, but hey, it ain't cheap!",
  "Dank and fruity, which is balanced by a fair bit of sour apple. Quite pleasant.",
  "Thin, dank, juicy. Citrusy and a little bitter for a NEIPA. This one is underrated. I didn't expect this from Pit C. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Dry, bitter, old school, but still very drinkable.",
  "You wouldn't know it's a collab w BBC. Typical Dominion harshness and oniony bitterness. Still enjoyable, though.",
  "Fruit, tart, wild, delicious, not too sour. Not too tropical. Very tasty, I could drink a lot of this.",
  "Grape, not too sweet, a little hoppy, of little interest to me. Almost an IPA, not a full BA. Good value for $. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Light, fluffy, a tad tart, fresh, refreshing... didn't realize it was a thing. Not much history, other than that it's very fucking nice. 3.9",
  "Dat! Huge fruity nose that slowly but surely follows through on the palate. Some resin without the typical roast aftertaste.",
  "Textbook Galaxy explosion. Looks awesome, tastes amazing (grape). Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "Coffee is good, good bitterness, not too sour. Not very complex, other than that, delicious....",
  "Those pils? No, no and no dry time. Classy AF, don't come back.",
  "Vaguely reminds me of my school years. Good balance, love them well! 4.4/5",
  "Excellent mouthfeel, as usual for Badlands. This one isn't the biggest for a beer, but it's still sweet, fruity, relatively dry, refreshing... and probably a bit less green still than a lot of their IPAs. 3.65",
  "Really like the brown ale taste, well, this is the one I get...",
  "Serious beer, interesting one.",
  "Raspberry exceptional, better than Cuv√©e Ren√©. Nice sourness, not too sour. A great summer beer. 4.35",
  "Watered down apple juice. Pretty acidic, but not too acidic, just sweet enough.",
  "Very nice, little bitterness, maybe a hint of pumpkin, very refreshing. 4.12.",
  "Very sour, very piney, very simple. Fruity, but I expected something more complex. 3.9.",
  "Fruit, tart, harsh, not much mouthfeel. Probably more barrelly than traditional, maybe because it's aged so much better. üíï",
  "A little disappointing because of the other brewery, they‚Äôre pretty similar. Creamy, hoppy.",
  "Sticking to 4. Average mouthfeel, boozy. Bourbon & coconut are quite subtle.",
  "Never tasted before. Pleasant, sweet and old school. Seriously ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è",
  "Fruity-almost-Scotch, slightly tart, quite enticing, would make for a cool trip beer nightcap if it had more malt ü§î. 4.35",
  "Doesn't taste like 8%. Then again, didn't buy it when it was so nice",
  "Still one of the best NEIPAs. Could be a tad less sweet, but other than that, this one is great. 3.6",
  "Huge jam, tastes like real cherries. Great texture. From the guys over at HAPPY NEW YEAR!",
  "Powerful. Great mouthfeel. Some funk. Good choice for a backyard brew. 4.12.",
  "Very nice, great mouthfeel, saturated, tropical.  Merci Renaud B.",
  "Not bad, but Somewhat light. Vanilla and lactose, not very sweet. 3.85/5",
  "Arguably their best one so far. East meets West. Nice combination. Tasty yet well made.",
  "Crazy mouthfeel. Pretty good, but hoppy. Frothy AF!",
  "It's sweet and oaky and not too dry or anything. Very tart and balanced. Would prefer it more canned though. Merci Matthieu L. et tarde pas √† l‚Äôenfiler",
  "Simple but tasty: raspberry, chocolate, coffee and, of course, alcohol. A good pale ale, but the vanilla is nauseating. 4.2/5",
  "You wouldn't know it's a collab w BBC. Typical Dominion harshness and oniony bite. Boozy. Nothing to do w BBC mastery and mellowness. 4.12.",
  "Forgot I said that... pretty much before the show... hazy, hoppy, really goes well with a Passion Fruit dessert üòé",
  "Batch #6, still cool for a party ship",
  "A lot hazier than your typical Messorem. Vanilla, coffee, vanilla too. Pleasant. Nose is different, but apparently more malty than chocolatey.",
  "Decent IPA. Thought it was something I was going to get once I had a taste. Nice.",
  "All right, and pretty sour for a pale ale, too. Still decent.",
  "Sticking to 4. Average mouthfeel, boozy. Almost cake. 3.9",
  "How can you go wrong with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy? The usual BBC class, melon, tropical fruit and an amazing mouthfeel. A good Pit C stout.",
  "Now in a can. A little thinner than I remember, methinks. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Outstanding. Really not bad, one of the best Hypas.",
  "Vaguely fruity, quite dry. Pretty much like a kriek. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Just like so many other breweries in Ontario, even I don't get it.",
  "Hard to resist when visiting; almost 4.",
  "Rum, raisins, caramel, nice sourness. Well balanced. Would never have bought this 2 yrs ago, but still nice. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Thick, dank, juicy. Citrusy, bitter at first, but then warms up and warms up and warms up. This is yummy. March for Life!",
  "Not very fizzy, rather complex, funk, apple. Interesting. Refreshing.",
  "Simple stout, apple is hardly noticeable, but it does show on the palate. A welcome change. 4.15/5",
  "Tart yet delicate. Quite sweet and delicate. Refreshing. Nice.",
  "Meh... that's moderation....",
  "Tropical, melon, good texture, nice DDH kick. Very good. 3.9",
  "Now on tap, pretty damned sweet.",
  "How can you go wrong with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy? The usual BBC class, melon, tropical fruit and an amazing mouthfeel. A great nightcap for a small change. 4.5",
  "Rather sweet, I think it's more barrelly than anything else. Very bitter.",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, and in a bit, too sweet.",
  "Surprisingly smooth, I thought it was coconut sugar. Slight üå∂, tropical, I loved it!",
  "Quite boozy nose, not as saturated as the first batch.   Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Nice fruit, moderate mouthfeel. Delicious üòã",
  "Maybe the best texture. Mosaic. Nicely gueuzey. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very tasty Sabro. Very good.",
  "Not bad, kind of old school, but I expected something harsher from Almanac. Good, though, if you want a little more bite than Nickel Brook. 3.65",
  "Batch #7, still awesome, though a little sweet lately. A notch down, but still very drinkable, even if now-a-week it‚Äôs sub-par. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Pleasant coffee, light spices and just a hint of thyme, and a trace of salt. Quite pleasant.",
  "Good mouthfeel, very sour, not very dry, fresh, not too sour. Gros merci Marie-Christine et Matthieu L.",
  "Slightly metallic final that fades when warming up. Fruity, vanilla, good mouthfeel, ok sweet. But I would drink this again, before going back to work.",
  "Kind of BTP, somewhat molasses...",
  "Thin prune saison. Quite nice.",
  "Easy 4.3 on the nose. Plum, red wine, and pretty much no taste. Interesting.",
  "Lupulus is a mighty good NEIPA, better than I thought. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I feel I get a porter, rather sour than sour, although I like it better. Medium sourness. Great saison.",
  "Coffee and sour are like cats and dogs, not a good fit. Odd at best. Merci Matthieu L. & Vincent L.",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy. Fruity but acidic with a somewhat dry finish. I'd keep a few of those lovely small cans cold come summer",
  "Rum and raisins nicely, and as usual, good mouthfeel. One of their good ones. 4.4",
  "Very dry, not that sour, maybe a little old school, not that familiar, just that good.",
  "Too sour for me, I like it sweeter.   Merci Matthieu L. et... Renaud?",
  "Very light and refreshing, nothing is wrong. Slight oak presence. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "First time in a can. One of my fave Bellwoods IPAs. Dank, not overly sweet or tropical, good booziness, summer ain't over yet. 4.35",
  "Simple can.",
  "Not very complex, but well made. Fruity. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Pleasantly surprised. Not a style I know, this is unexpectedly hazy, creamy, coconut, mouthfeel is amazing, coffee really nice, other than that, just awesome. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Too sweet, too tropical, too honest. Quite malty, too malty. Would taste better in a lighter T, but not a very good IPA. Merci Matthieu L. and Tyson S. (Matatatow) ü•∞",
  "Very mild, delicate chardonnay, lovely. Lovely üòä",
  "Quite boozy nose, not much aftertaste. Diff't league...",
  "Very good quality old school IPA, very familiar one, I'd call it that. Almost 4.25.",
  "It's a porter, session version is nice, session A session....",
  "Batch. A little bretty, a bit thin, but still not a bad IPA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Surprisingly spicy for a porter. Some citrus and some pineapple. Pretty nice.",
  "Pale ale, rather light, but still piney and bitter. The fruit is pleasant and somewhat acidic, though not as much as some people expect. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Thinner than I remember. Sweet, thin, but still enjoyable. 4.15/5",
  "Another delicious one from the masters! Similar to Fruity Easy or KBS. 3.9",
  "Not bad, old school, but a little thin.",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy, from the first sip to the last. Creamy, very well done.",
  "More sour than expected, better to earth. Ok.",
  "A little on the sweet side, rather upfront, but refreshing and inoffensive by itself. On the nose, too sour for my liking. Pleasant. Mouthfeel OK. 4.25",
  "Fresh can, maybe a tad raw (they cut a slip too far). Good hops, though a little subdued. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Odd coffee and vanilla taste, rather vague. OK.",
  "Oh! This is so good, I want to sip it alone! It's got a fruit taste to it, rich and tropical. This is a good kind of jam üòú",
  "Now you're talking! Great mouthfeel, saturation, tropical fruit and citrus. Really good value for $. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Coffee and vanilla. Good balance. On second thought, as it warms up, I find it gets awfully sweet (and ultimately tastes like candy). Merci Matthieu L.",

  "Fruit, tartness, sourness. Very nice!",
  "Very sour, very piney. Quite pleasant. Love it.",
  "So sweet, delicate, old school...",
  "Trillium üçí present, ok, a little harsh, just sweet enough, not too bitter, I‚Äôm just not into that style.",
  "I think this is the best porter I've had from OK. Very fruity, nice balance, very nice, if only a little tingling. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Medium tart, still very drinkable, but that \"medium tartness\" (my reference is BTP) means something. Could be sweeter. Still solid.",
  "Almost a month old, but still nice. Vanilla and lactose aren't getting in the way, which bodes well for the future. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Sugar plum üçí ü••, not overly sour, very delicate, nice üçá, and a little tropical. üíïüíï",
  "Solid IPA, from the brewery that makes them. Honest ale, but brandy would be a tall order.",
  "Sticking to 4. Average mouthfeel, boozy. Boozy on the nose. Rather boozy. Throat take away in the mouth. Ok.",
  "Maple nonetheless. Definite bourbon taste, but I'm dubious. Not a big fan of sour IPAs, but this is the best one I've had from PA. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Simple. Easy 4.25...",
  "Outstanding! Creamy, super smooth, with just enough sugar to take away. This is very good, I want more! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "All right I guess, Bas-Canada, but still not bad.",
  "Really not that bad, I expected worse. Still very nice, but Friday night won't happen again. 3.9",
  "Nose is all coffee. In the mouth, coffee right away, then cocoa, vanilla, cocoa and vanilla, then finally chocolate. Very interesting.",
  "Mmh, not much to it. I think it's just a session: session. Nice session.",
  "Very mild, delicate chardonnay and üçí. Quite nice. Could be sweeter. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "It doesn't disappoint on the palate. Amazing hops, DDH, earthy balance. Very good texture. If you don't mind, it's a real treat.",
  "Oh, crap! Best Buddies IPA I've had so far. Huge coconut barrel, that's the flavour. Merci Simon L.",
  "Very good IPA, very traditional. Glad it went better",
  "Awesome IPA, although I'd say it‚Äôs a porter. Not as good as expected, but still very good. 4.35",
  "Harsh at first but wins you over with its complex history. A great intro to the new year. üíï",
  "Juicy, very light, tropical, not much sour beer at all. Very good!",
  "Last night. Great mouthfeel, nice DDH, slight acetic apple, decent mouthfeel. Dry, malty. Can't say I get the honey. Ok.",
  "Refreshing, very delicate üçí, nice mouthfeel. Very well done! 4.4, I want more! Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I think they lowered the ABV a notch. Good balance, if a tad thin...",
  "Seems a little more rounded after a couple of weeks. Still a good quality coffee stout.",
  "Not bad, maybe not the best IPA around, but hey, it's your last good damned IPA!",
  "A good old-school DIPA, bitter, piney, with a little twist (VT yeast?). Good mouthfeel, not too sweet, easy drinking, if a little boozy, considering it's an ENGLISH IPA. 4.35/5",
  "As decadent as expected from Dominion. Will have to revisit, it just doesn't cut ü§î to keep up with my luscious body. 3.9",
  "Pretty sour, very melon, but other than that, rather similar to English berry.",
  "2nd-anniversary release. I know nothing of the region, but I'd say it's still fairly fresh out of Messorem. And delicious...",
  "A trip back in time. Pretty malty, a bit hoppy, not quite  full of üçí, i.e. Marnier. Hoppy. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Low-key blonde, which I definitely is. Very nice lady!",
  "Not that familiar with sour beers, but this is like a super nice fruity AF sour. So nice!!!",
  "Very sour, very piney. Has the typical sour bruin, but other than that, it‚Äôs delicious.  Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Fruit juice with slight hop burn. Interesting, but I prefer my IPAs more hoppy. 4.15 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Good nose, very tropical, coffee. Not a true NEIPA, but still very pleasant. If only it had the KBS mouthfeel...",
  "One of their best DIPAs, if not the best. Very well done, good hop combo and dry hop. üíï",
  "Serious stuff! Foam, fruit, wine: OS, malty, but still delicious, especially for a non-nano IPA. Respect!",
  "Rather funky, very little PA, delicate peach and passion fruit, but I would bet it wasn't the ideal mouthfeel. 4.15",
  "Similar to Jester King's Blind Pig Head, only with more maple. Very nice, but a little thin.",
  "I don't get that DIPA seems to be getting much traction. Nice, crisp, but not overly sweet. 4.12 Merci Renaud B.",
  "Seems a little thinner than last time, good coffee and good malt, reminiscent of P√©ch√© wine.  4.4",
  "So much better than au Sarsaparilla!",
  "This is not the best batch.",
  "Coffee and vanilla. Very similar, but tastes more like gueuze than wine. Good, though I‚Äôd add more sugar. Quite sweet.",
  "Dry, earthy, a little metallic. Quite nice, but I expected more",
  "Trying it in a can this time, almost a year old. Upping it a notch, not too too bad.",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot! Ha smooth! üòä",
  "Simple golden color. Very nice!",
  "Decent IPA, but it comes out ahead. Tasty, if a tad thin. Merci  Gros merci Matthieu L.",
  "I think they overdid it. Too sweet, pungent, oniony. The mouthfeel is there, though. 4.12.",
  "Dry, bitter, rather old school, but still very drinkable. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Dry and rather sweet, it's complex and enjoyable, a dessert üòä",
  "Fruit, tartness, tartness, tartness... Almost boozy (got 3-month-old can). A little sweet, it's definitely more sour than expected, which is always nice.",
  "The perfect summer night beer! That many points!",
  "Pretty typical Messorem, good mouthfeel, boozy. One of if not the best JK I've had. 4.4 üíï Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Disappointing, the vanilla isn't very strong, but still a good mouthfeel. This I wouldn't hesitate to give to a friend. 3.9",
  "Rum, raisins, caramel, just bitter enough, pretty nice, but not as much as I remember.",
  "Hard to resist when visiting. Love it as it is, if not the best IPA around!",
  "Rather mellower than my fave JK. Dry finish. Unique.",
  "This is very good, I dig the brown sugar and the coffee. Quite oat-ish. 4.12.",
  "Wow! Winey, very pale, but with some bite. One of my all-time favourite BBC IPAs. 4.6. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Coffee and chocolate. More bitter than expected. Bitter, more malty than chocolate. Yawn!",
  "Dry, earthy, a little astringent. But I'd prefer it sweeter. Funk. Boozy. Well... not much aftertaste.",
  "You can't go wrong with BBC IPAs. Always good! Going up to 5.",
  "Very nice on the nose. Fruit does come out nicely, though. Pleasant coffee and very nice bourbon mouthfeel. Easy drinking. 4.35",
  "Highly puckering. Very mild, mild cold, sweet but not too sour. Reminds me of Nickel Brook's Headstock, maybe a tad less sweet than I used to value... üíïüíïüíïüíï",
  "Citra and Simcoe, tropical, dank, tongue-tingling, yummy",
  "Sticking to 4. Average mouthfeel, boozy. Bourbon tastes very much at the heart of Nelson Sauvin. Wish it were thicker.",
  "Refreshing, very delicate, delicate üçí, very delicate. Some love, but I don't see much of it. Very old school.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb! Easily the best IPA I've had from OH. Less hop bite than expected, keep up the good work.",
  "Light, fluffy, simple. Pretty good. Share it!",
  "Very ordinary, typical Quebec IPA.",
  "A little old school, like so many other IPAs I've tried. No one should taste that much better than this.",
  "Rather sweet, I expected something from a porter. Vanilla. Not typical for SK. Tastes closer to malty, yet refreshing. Greenish üçí.",
  "Not bad, maybe not the best IPA around, but hey, respect!  3.9",
  "Very frothy, dank, juicy, tropical. Tropical! Tropical coffee! üíï",
  "Serious DIPA, very light, but not overly sweet. Trace of lime. Approved.",
  "Very ok, not very saturated. Quite nice. 3.9",
  "Surprisingly thin for ABV (10.3%). Dark chocolate comes forward, hazelnut & bourbon are more discrete. Good, though something‚Äôs missing. 3.6",
  "Dessert! Very nice, lots of vanilla, but not overly sweet or dry like in the pic.  Delicious! üòú",
  "Maybe I'm stepping too far from NEIPAs. This is something I've been holding back on lately, however. Too much sugar, too much bourbon and so on. Just too bitter. Really doesn‚Äôt make the beer. 3.9",
  "Huge raspberry on the nose. Salt is just present, but you'd never guess it was chocolate. You need that sometimes here.",
  "Rather complex, quite dank and oaky. Nice texture. Similar to P√©ch√© mortel. 4.12",
  "In the same range as Bissell, maybe a little less sweet, but still an ok NEIPA.",
  "Really awesome hop bill. A little weak, but one of class. Well done, I dig yah!",
  "Just salty enough Galaxy Jam (juice?). Pretty nice.",
  "Interesting, very citrusy, quite bitter, although not in the same way. More like a session? 3.85",
  "Pleasantly surprised. Not a style I'm familiar with. Berliner than I remember, probably because of Cocoa Crown. Ok.",
  "Now you're talking! Great mouthfeel, lovely coffee, satisfying üòç! 4.15",
  "Very frothy, almost creamy. Fruity, but I can see why...",
  "Now in the can. Good mouthfeel, green. Slight DDH, certainly on point. 4.38 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "I think this is my favourite SPBW batch so far. A great one.",
  "Liquid Galaxy  Bretty, milkshake, vinous, nice fruity touch, slightly tart, a little flat. 4.15",
  "That falls flat. Boozy, but not overly sweet, either. Nice jam. Almost a full bottle.",
  "Like a light Berliner, minus the bomb, but still a very good mouthfeel. 4.35/5",
  "Honest coffee stout, not much vinegar, good mouthfeel. Quite acidic, but not overly so. Thinnish (I expected Nelson Sauvin or something). Good texture, but not overly sweet. 4.15",
  "Delicious raspberry nose. Salt is surprisingly present. Sweet but not overly. Quite nice!",
  "Now you're talking.  Really not bad, the coffee is nice but I was expecting more 'n smooth. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Fruit, tart, citrusy, kind of old-school IPA.",
  "A little thin, but very decent, coffee too. I was expecting something more along the lines of Galaxy or Nuance-ish. Still cool though.",
  "Fruity, sour and boozy from Belgium. This is very good. Would prefer it less berry however. Not sure if it's better or not.",
  "Mmmhhh! This is so good, meh! üíï",
  "Oh, do them oats and Mosaic ever hit the spot! üòã",
  "üçí üçí üçí üç∑ üç∑. Not too sour, funk, oak. Very nice. üíï",
  "Les thick than expected. Rather boozy, raisin and molasses. Quite boozy when present, but a little too boozy in the mouth. Like a boozy Pepsi...",
  "Frrooty-frrooty! Creamy, rich, delicious, üçí, chocolate, coffee. This is very good. 4.12!",
  "Luscious mouthfeel, lovely bourbon kick, chocolate. Amazing! üíïüíïüíïüíï",
  "Seems a little more traditional, less sweet, but I like it.",
  "Wow! Tropical bomb. Very nice!",
  "Wow! Love it. Great dessert! Better than expected. Amazing mouthfeel, yummy! Merci Antoine C. et Matthieu L.",
  "Frrooty-frrooty! Very good smell, really tasty, not too sour, lemongrass, tropical.",
  "üçí and pepper come out nicely, kind of like coconut sugar. Traditional West-Coast style, but a little much. 4.15",
  "As good as expected from Dominion. Thick, dry, coarse. Pleasant. Tastes quite similar, but different...",
  "I don't think this is the best IPA.",
  "Great mouthfeel, good BA finish, nice balance. Not too complex as expected from Pit C. 1-month waiting order...",
  "Nose is all coffee. In the mouth, coffee right away, then vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate, coffee and warming. Good mouthfeel. 4.35",
  "My fav Bor√©ale version. Love this hops, and these guys just pack it in. Meh... 4.6",
  "My first Cantillon! Delicious and spicy, tropical, tropical bomb! TIPA must have in Ontario hands down!",
  "Oh, don't miss it!",
  "Very nice mouthfeel, pretty bretty. Dry finish. Fresh can. Merci Renaud B.",
  "Very good Quality 1st time around, better than Gambrinus.",
  "Fruity DIPA, tart, a little hoppy, probably because of the lactose. Not bad.",
  "I'm pleasantly surprised for a non-BA imperial stout. Rich malt and chocolate, and decent mouthfeel. Like a weak Hypa. 4.2 Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Very delicate and delicate. Pretty well balanced. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Wow! üçí pie! Almost dessert! 4.5",
  "Not sweet enough... Not much bitterness, but I guess there is a bit of vanilla. Merci Matthieu L.",
  "Extra juicy can",
  "Happy to try it on tap instead of having to buy a whole bottle. Typical Ottawa sour, too much syrup and too little mouthfeel. Definitely a treat.",
  "Honest stout. A little sour, but tasty. Could be sweeter. @",
  "You know, for the price ($6), this is really not bad! Splendid drinking time.",
  "Oh yes! Tropical greatness! Tropical fruit! Refreshing! Very nice!",
  "Very nice and coffee, not too bitter, very mild, very tropical.",
  "Lovely fruit, very mild, refreshing. Fresh can.",
  "Oh! This is a good one!",
  "Solid Pale ale, we're close ü§î",
  "Thin and light, not much on the mouth. Quite thin.",
  "Not that different from regular JK. Very mild, nothing to write home about.",
  "Spread the fiver on sour üçí üçí üçí!!! Pretty sour, but not overly sour, you guessed it. Delish.",
  "Rather sour than complex, some funk and dust. Very pleasant, if a tad thin for a NEIPA.",
  "Nice texture. Peach, but not much mouthfeel. Almost a pale ale. Good texture. Doesn't taste like so much beer. 3.85",
  "Even with all those great NEIPAs, none of them are as good as the last one. This time around, I can tell the difference. Merci Matthieu L. & Tyson S. (outstanding job!)",
  "Weak nose, rather bitter. Rather bitter. Nice."
